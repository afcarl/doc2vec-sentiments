the scene shifts to a prison in china  where han sing  jet li  learns of his brothers murder  
the one potentially interesting character  carrieanne moss  spends her time alone in the orbiting ship talking to a computer  
there are lots of fights  gun battles  lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  
and albert the angel  played by miscast cuba gooding  jr   says bluntly   thats fantasy

barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang  and hattie jacques small but effective role as the rectors housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection  
he seems like a raving lunatic  obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis

say  tell me if youve seen this before  a crisis onboard a commercial airliner causes a stewardess to have to fly and land the plane herself  
too excited to pay any attention  the hapless losers plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home  
the movie doesnt even work as an action film  
newcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and dravens scrappy ward  
there are also a few cameos in the film here and there  which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more  
why a supernatural being  one of the undead  needs such skills is beyond me  
the ads for  batman and robin  scream  the event of the summer is here  and thats the problem  
annie is a happy woman  
for the first portion of this review  im going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk  
id rather think of   the butcher boy   as a brief diversion for director jordan  rather than a total misfire  
ace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a canyon  in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallones cliffhanger  jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect  or lack of  and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness  or  in his case  a level of consciousness   
it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with  the financially strapped  ruggedly handsome  intelligent 35yearold alan  alan   who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist  
but enough about the differences  
in that case  the premise was implanting someone elses memories as a way to enhance ones own life through a dream vacation  
i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie  shed walk out after about 5 minutes  and youd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it  
and how did he think he was giving a good performance here  
yea  
since most cineplexes wont be granting refunds to the latter contingency   commander  might rake in some dough  but be warned  the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation  
the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie  if you dont count neil simons biloxi blues   
  even watching the first movie i wondered why any reallife team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner   
wait for his scene because its actually pretty good  
with a little more maturity and different handling   mandingo  might have been an effective  worthwhile film  
a living  
connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of  and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son  
thats about as complex as it gets  
the magazine article and the film script are two very different media  
hoffmans acting seems muted  
this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script  
shes the chief navigator on a sea vessel  travelling with her is captain everton  donald sutherland   steve baker  william baldwin   woods  marshall bell   squeaky  julio oscar mechoso   and richie  sherman augustus   
its exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish  poking fun at something serious  in this case mental illness   throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh  
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off  
were talking ralph fiennes here  one of the best actors working today  one of the best actors  ever   
armageddon cost over 100 million to make  
basically  its an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage  interviews  etc  somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film  
add that to lisa kudrow  boring us with yet another one of her patented  dumb blonde  routines  but this time  dressed in sexier outfits  
enter howie long  
one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes   we may be done with the past  but the past is not done with us   
kids raised on  men in black   nonmonkey effects also by baker  are going to find ron   tremors   underwoods outing a little lame by comparison  
  a far superior film in any league   
there is some promise  but its all in the setup  
they hire the worlds best oil driller  bruce willis   and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem  
armageddon is a comedy  with a capital  c   
who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid  stunt   
his intention is obviously world domination  
the geny actress  with her cold stare and big  black eyes  has appeared in an impressive range of films  but she doesnt even come close to being the bold heroine the film  set against the historical backdrop of world war 2  requires her to be  
his girlfriends a stripper sharing a subplot with  striptease  in that she has to do it for her son  
these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music  
the story is very minimal and basic  
and through the whole thing theres quaid  playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea gal  
their game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman  
there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything thats on the page  
holy man 
however  because of the films selfirony  black humour and fascinating cinematography  i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long  long time  
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface  
overall  the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat  
ok    maybe 
it doesnt add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random  
at the last minute  though  miramax did decide to screen the film  so hastily scheduled was the screening that myerss last name was misspelled on the invitation  not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes  for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed  myself included  
its merely that with osmosis jones  the farrellys humor is too juvenile  too predictable  
you see  the point of a remake is  or at least it should be  to iron out the originals flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection  
i could go on and on  
you know the type  haunted by his job  yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist  
when twins owner roger dorn  once again portrayed by corbin bernsen  needs a new manager for his aaa team  he offers the job to gus  who is now faced with two daunting tasks  turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson  played by walt goggins  for a promotion to  the show   
dressed like cloaked monk  he leads her to doubt herself and her  revelations   
villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy  
and  why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes   
we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents  
that should teach us for squishing all those bugs  
he squints  he kills  
the boss had all ready threatened him  falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jacks toes by the gravesite  
oh  sure  zwick thinks he is making a  meaningful  action film  since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism  but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than  say   die hard   which also starred bruce willis  
its a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel  
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office  
his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink  
the thrust of the whole film explains  easily enough  what we are to think of that moment  what it means when she walks away from a particular situation  
having a career as one of the industrys best cinematographers  bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots  and  romeo must die  does look good  
performances are mostly subpar with mcgowan providing only a few good moments  compared with her excellent work in the doom generation  1995  and scream  1996   and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty  
the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and  out of context  made it sound hip  
and i was impressed  
yawn  
vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis  cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry  and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner  
john carpenters vampires is none of these  
while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home  cages goal is different but just as simple  to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact  
at some point  referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas  
its an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions  
example  the man  suffering from the onset of the virus  or so i assumeeverything is obscure in this movie  vomits through the hole  
the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog  
and then theres some atrocious dialogue  which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound   look at all these pickles  
pure hilarity  
also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated    
director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags  
of course  as the formula goes  her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck  there are people in high places who will go down with this  because yes  this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world  that is  america  since watergate  
between the action sequences  it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr  russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes  since his dialog is extremely limited  
unfortunately  when johns audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost  
simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film  and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent  unfair world against his will  with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him  
he was born on an ocean liner on 111900  uh  hence the name   abandoned and adopted by danny  a ship crewman  
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary  
with no exception  you know what is going to happen before it happens  
also  the movie is so intent on giving you a hootinducing  lipsmacking villain  the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter  natch  that it completely casts garcias frank connor by the dullsville wayside   desperate measures  appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist  and the movies headscratcher of a sendoff confirms this  
all in all i found this movie boring and very slow  the acting was good but the story just didnt evolve enough and wasnt captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch  
characters die  heads are lopped off  but they were only supporting roles anyway  so why should we care  
we never develop connections to the characters  never given a reason to care  
rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure  rather lamely too   and singer lisa loeb    
castingwise  ready to rumble is an odd duck  
thats how it works in movies like these  
they are given official skull paddles  
if you do  you may want to watch it  groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot  and feel good that you didnt spend money renting it  
even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonists foibles  she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint  
depending on who you ask  the original sin was either the eating of the apple  the act of disobedience against god  or the act of betrayal  
unfortunately  its impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this  
or  maybe all career politicians are like that  
his best performances are still on  e  r    
director scott kalvert doesnt have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work  so he substitutes silly slowmotion photography  selfconsciously funky camera angles and choppy editing  
and you got the feeling that these crass people couldnt act like this all the time  
even when viewed from an itssobaditsgood angle  this movie isnt all that successful  
one bright spot  speaking from a strictly sexist point of view  is traci lin  who plays charlies very skeptical girlfriend  
catherine keener is good  although too quick to threaten divorce  as mrs  wells  
patricks overriding compulsion  to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring  
in 1989  director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama   glory   but since then  he has made continuous disappointments  to me at least  with 1994s  legends of the fall   and 1996s  courage under fire   
is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy  sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography  
hell no  they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie  
dr  fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went  
on the ship  they make a bunch of clunky  immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people  
all in all  the movie stinks  
the military  with dr  tatopouloss help  have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system  
luckily  a limited release has made it easy to avoid  
the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monicas party  
unfortunately  every scene about alfreds sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance  they just go through the motions  losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart  
there are even some halfhearted attempts of humour  both intentional and unintentional  like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle  but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronsons 1970s classics  
back on the space station orbiting earth  woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing  
but do not drop a limp uturn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as  an oliver stone movie   and not question why it stinks like weekold snook  
theres a lot of things i didnt understand about this scene  first of all the owner of the mercedes isnt some yuppie or old rich snob  hes like a hippie straight out of the 60s  
i have no inherent problem with her character  it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired  
their purpose isnt just to move the plot along  theyre also supposed to give the storyline a backbone

  you better hold on to your joystick   is one such line  
finally  when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role  the film left me with another question  what was the point  
i cant say either for  the way of the gun   because it has very little going for it and i cant imagine anyone intelligently defending it  
norm mcdonald fares nearly as well  as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle  
gratuitous crotch shots abound  one of which makes the zipper cutaway in  theres something about mary  look like the height of subtlety    
i wonder whats funnier  the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that diney thought fans of this film would want to see them  
why  
lucky bastard  
how the hell do you make a popcorn scifi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film  
it just goes to show  an intelligent person isnt necessarily an admirable storyteller  
and then theres moore  who may not have much prior experience in comedy  but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress  
his popularity has gone through the roof and hes getting his career off the ground  
while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd  married his ho and turned square  working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer  
too bad his minutes onscreen are so few  
a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past  and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films  so what was the point  
its not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics  
first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckleoutloud moments  and even some decent laughs here and  way  over there  but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that youll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn  
heres someone that spent their time robbing banks  and now as she heads onto the street  were supposed to feel sorry for her  
the characters also make incredibly dumb moves  especially paltrow  and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel  
vampires lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamerthin plot  
the effects are a bit better this time around  but the film doesnt work nearly as well  
they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward  and when they landonce in a while  when we need a break from the space sequencesthey cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like

the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeths theatres

this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes  
branagh was also fun as the scenerymunching  overthetop bad guy  but thats pretty much where the entertainmentbuck stopped  
the only solution that his wife  magda szubanski  going from delightfully charming to downright annoying  can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair  i think  and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank  set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public   
now normally when i say that its followed with the joke     because the movie is finally over

unfortunately  it is also the first film i have seen from 1999

comments  watchers reborn  a cheaply made directtovideo turkey  is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontzs bestselling novel watchers  
how stupid  
blade squad is dumb  
of course  the golden rule of sequels is that there must be least one recurring character for continuitys sake  
this film reaches a level that transcends the  so bad its good  level and borders on the downright insane  
the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell  
the problem is that there isnt much of a story even though it does  
but it wasnt until the very end that i finally put my finger on why  the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies  such as young sherlock holmes  but from cheesy primetime sitcoms  
darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cashstrapped family  and this  serious  angle seems to come from an entirely different movie  
she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast  
saget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman  adam sandler  and john goodman  but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent dirtywork from sputtering to the end of its brief 81minute running time  
new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category  c  than in the other two combined  much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons  
it promised to be something unusual  
but there are no real subtle comic moments  
the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons  
that story also is left uncompleted  perhaps to show harrys unwillingness to commit even to telling a story  
armageddon also has lots of action  with a capital  a

to be completely honest  i havent had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life  
 moral dilemma of teresas father  
rather  why write him into the film  give 
love  
one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories  but its only followed up on in a token fashion  
  its clear the film doesnt want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability  the most minimal amount necessary  comes across as a halfassed effort  
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful  sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality  but they fail  
robert rodriguez  who directed the terrific low budget  el mariachi  came to hollywood and directed the horrible  highbudget  desperado   
strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotapes sticker in black marker  not typically a good sign when you rent a film   
in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter  toninho oliveira  murilo ben  cio  and marries him

in that time  prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable  if brash and bullheaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets  motorcycles and punk rock music  
in the film  rose mcgowan fares the best  
ellsworth bumpy johnson        lawrence 
upon impact  rugged everyman and perennial dogooder bill paxton rushes in  containing the emotional crowd with an earnest  move along now folks  theres nothing to see here   
the cartoon is way better  
or maybe im just too jaded  too much of a critic  not relaxed enough to enjoy this fluffpiece    uuuhhmmm    naaaaah   
and in the last one  it was a chat with nicole  
and if you dont believe me  go back and rent  godzilla   and tell me if theres even one shot where we see godzilla either a  in his entirety in one wide shot  or b  n the light so that we can at least see him  well  you dont really have to sit through it again  just take my word for it   
there are a lot of scenes like this one  and none of them are very coherent  
projections of the subconscience  
patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene  the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over  with his good looks and money  
so  sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal  which is too explicit to state here   
isnt that the whole plot  
delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality  
larson and lebrock fight and torture each other  the tables get turned a couple of times  while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help  
  mystery men  indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says  i knew you could do it   
his entrance  however  is a grand one  out from the trees he leaps  gargantuan and imposing  sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug  and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have  
offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldnt think twice about pushing your motherinlaw off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete  
it is all routine stuff  
for  twin peaks  junkies  like me  the movie is only marginally improved  
truth be known  i dont really think i can answer this question  
  why dont we see patients until the third year   he bursts out every three seconds  
to that i say  you can give mariah carey a movie  but that certainly dont mean it should be done  
  town and country  has a pedigree befitting its title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry   the graduate   under the direction of peter chelsom   funny bones    
it is beautiful  but not the least bit frightening  
 the subtitles of our print were white  often on a white background making them often hard to read  but i dont think there was a whole lot of meaning there that was lost  
platt and white  on the other hand  seem to be giving their best efforts  and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script  
please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews  
get the picture  
prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989s  leviathan   1989s  deep star six   and all four  alien  pictures  
mr  freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholsons joker and danny devitos penguin  
there are some worthwhile moments  such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages  although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who arent bilingual   
even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn  
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an  evil  bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its  prey  is very well done  
it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from  
its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the war on drugs is about to be escalated into colombia  
fans of this movie  if any exist  should enjoy the dvd release  
this  in and of itself  is not bad  but  after a while  it has a juvenile feel to it  
speaking in a calm  soft voice  portraying death as a lonely  distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters  
to hammer home the point of how antisemitism hasnt gone away theres a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge  bradley   who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator  
if youre interested in the plot  youre better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the onscreen shenanigans   jeanclaude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with  nanobombs  hidden in cabbage patch knockoffs  
it tries to be a spyromance movie  but without any suspense the film just looks like its an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses  
but  as i said  it moves slowly and in that way  its more painful than funny  
the big showdown at the end  that turns east new york into the sarajevolike battle zone  is probably the worst part of the movie  because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget  
even better  
  think charlie and irene will fall in love  
  just to make an idle point  i did like  toy story   but that was good  also  i have this aversion to bad french farces  and if they remake them into american films  
and also  i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a subplot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent  they cant have contact with any humans really  
the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot  which could be fodder for a valentines day episode of  the xfiles   
to many american mothers theres probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a womans  ice cold tits   
whats worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic  the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm  
sure  you get to sit on marlboro signs  but whats that compared to getting to be with meg ryan

i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian  its just that so far he hasnt been able to find the right film to showcase his talents  
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen  and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry

the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues  
even the dialogue gets drowned out  
but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless  
the bottom line is that  simply irresistible  is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title  and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in midair  an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene   my mind checked out from the characters and the romance

  review written august 12  1998  
this is five minutes of material  thrown into the picture at the last minute  well past the onehour mark  and this isnt a long film to begin with   
one little side note  although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid  there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly

something happens though during the films final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive  
it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12 and 13yearold boys  it appears to have been made by them  
and it goes downhill from there  
  i know youre just a reporter  but you used to be a human being   
this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected  and rightly so  
it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics  without any car chases and gun fights  
unfortunately  the ending is rather poorly tied up  it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of liveaction film  or the original script  
in fact  every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do  
also on the bad side of acting is julie benz  almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers  
as if a cast deserving of their snack foodfate isnt bad enough  when you taunt the monster  youre really asking for it    deep rising  is a slow  stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot  
on one level  virus is almost passable fun

the answer  it looked cool  
as well she should  
skip this dull film  unless you want to see woods  or make fun of steigers accent  or see stones breasts again

certainly hodges is not complaining  
we already know that big movie studios mentality is shallow at best  and movies like  out of sight  and  saving private ryan  give you more faith in them  but movies like  virus  manage to drain a little more out of the pool

the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of eachs place in this reversed society  each important in the book  
now look at the warehouse fight from  rumble in the bronx   
although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former  it is still a long way from anything considered desirable  
besides the first part  there is also another good scene  a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station  
the whole reason the plot exists  julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station  is a dead giveaway  lessening suspense and creating a hurryupandwait timing problem

an 80year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch  wearing tightfitting leather  as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a pumpbitch

would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts  namely chow yunfat and jackie chan  
look  that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink

  it wasnt me   he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others  
when cane meets up with christine york  he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode  with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter

hes a neartotal loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight  
the films killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends  you know  like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that theyre coming from inside the house

  is that your recipe for frog soup   
as i sat through the seemingly endless  albeit fairly impressive  special effects  i kept wishing that this movie was about derns caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast

when youve finished watching urban legends  final cut  youll share my same grim point of view thanks to the horrible acting  terrible script  and ridiculous directing which has become all too common today

review by  geoff berkshire 
they decide they want to crash her babysitting job  looking for the typical babysitting hankypanky  
some have suggested that this isnt a problem  because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work  
the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over  as is evident in the final sequence  where there is no comedic denouement after the climax  
with this film  warner brothers has succeeded in retrograding the series back to its tv incarnation  
more importantly  it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is  
what about the computer  
if its anything like its depicted as here then its going to be incredibly boring  
this could have been a really cool movie  
its the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century  
perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity  
the first  park  was a marvellous film  full of aweinspiring sights  interesting characters  and genuine thrills  
why heroize the most demonic institution in america  the u  s  postal system  
the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills  
though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeares romeo and juliet  its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york  is very hard to associate with shakespeares poetry  
however  big momma is called away on an emergency  
despite her glamorous looks  however  we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her  
the slime  well  sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black  
ok  here it is  well get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so  
kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire  
take  john carpenters ghosts of mars   please   
maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks  
there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to  
there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see  mission to mars   
it would be dismissive  
  ok    
the dialogue in the film is  well  an embarrassment  
brazil is on my personal top ten  
and you have to factor in two more things from the subsequent scenes  as we find out powder has some sort of superintelligence   your i  q  
its a ten minute short film with ninetyfive minutes of filler  
the consequences are painful to watch  
now  that certainly is what id call magical  
the film ends without even telling the most interesting story  what happens on the international arena  
at least blade had decent action and slick stylishness  
their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that theyre typically inexpensive to produce  no special effects  no big name stars  and serve as vehicles to flash nudity  allowing them to frequent latenight cable television   
and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country  kevin bacons member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go  
then we have the cast  
if the plot is old  at least the style is creative  
and forsythe more than once threatens his family  
a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyones favorite goaliemaskwearing homicidal maniac  
it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set  
complacency rules  its been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters  real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue  
he incessantly talks to himself  mostly agonizing over his bitter marriage and chastising himself why he went out with elizabeth for a second time  and then why he married her just because she laughed at his jokes and was attractive  
i asked myself  what butterfly   
he was a willing participant in a creative travesty  
along the way  the intrepid explorers encounter bears  bald eagles  aging native american warriors  and a conquistador named hildago  kevin dunn  who raves about his beautiful hair  
mel shoots gun  
throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices  exception  men are shown burning to death with relative frequency   
sometimes  for example  the snake just moves too fast  
outside of that chuckle  unfortunately  tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors  for some reason  become increasing obnoxious  
being a fan of highlander and mr  connery  i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii  the quickening

this one isnt an exception  but similarities with british television are only in content  
our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid  
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities  
akiva goldsmans screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad  with astonishingly terrible dialogue  lame jokes  and an awful bythenumber plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement  
depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself  but regrettably  being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him starstruck  for he is completely hellbent on mimicking pacinos wellearned high style  
this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind  since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks  
the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this  so we actually figured most of it out by the halfway point  so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense  but it still didnt the make the film all that more entertaining  
what follows is about 2 hours of action  brought to us by the director of executive decision  1995   another film curiously involving a plane  
however  when asked how he learned the language  he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from latenight kungfu films  and soon gained mastery  
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable  with all the teen highschool angst movies coming out  there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think theyre smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined

at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking  the heavy accents  and the cockney language

andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress  is there any other kind in this movie   
you dont need to have seen the original  species  to appreciate how utterly lousy  species ii  is  
and what about the films main plot point  
and  of course  the film is very much like the abyss  1988   although in its defense  crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released  and is far superior to this rubbish   
you know what happens then  
he acts like the rapper that he is  
but when tragedy strikes  the violin becomes the personification of its makers grief  
  
the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him  from the samba to disco to the macarena  
and that is its only saving grace  
or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world  
michael jai white  a relative newcomer to theatrical releases  seems to be an appealing actor  and he handles his role adequately  but we see little of him without various masks on  
at the outset  were told each  game  is tailored to the individual  
there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties  
kiss of the dragon  jet lis second consecutive american misfire  plays like one big miscalculation  and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment  
there are a lot of fancy special effects  and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression  
make no mistake  deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing  
some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica  and some are total strangers  
im very sorry that i dont have this perspective  but  judging from the reviews ive already read  knowing the tv show just makes matters worse  
is it really as good as i think it is  
either that  or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldnt mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes  
but they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of  me  myself  irene  comes off as rote  bythenumbers  adolescent comedy  
characters are nonexistent  present are just some goodlooking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes  
just because you cant miss his outlandish fiery mane  dont skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature

not that loser is worth contemplating this seriouslygod knows heckerling didnt  
this years  winner  is the hurricane  pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool  
looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence  we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best  no strong lead characters  a blatant disregard for physics  and a very obvious naziesque theme  
tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick  
there are better ways to waste two hours of your life  
thats just her normal voice

from a material standpoint   switchback  is pretty empty  
audio is mono dolby digital  and the video is fair to good for a film like this  
she just popped up on screen  mumbled some lines  smoked and left  
it was boring for stretches  the acting was atrocious at times  the  romantic  scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe   there was little reason to care for anyone and since when were the musketeers fat  
eldard is good in his role  but is limited by the plot  
take for example the extended sequence where one of billys scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy

soon  zoologist gregg ohara  bill paxton  discovers joe  he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser  rade sherbedgia   who just happens to be the same guy who killed jills mother  
its obvious that those involved  specifically the actors  tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie  
mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear  which is good for the films budget   
  
the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned draggingsalting sequence  
battlefield long  boring and just plain stupid 
the result is that the entire production feels contrived

however in the course of his investigation tinam  who believed kitty had disappeared   runs into her again  but isnt quite sure if its her  
its mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based  
most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy  
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny

critique  this film is not a comedy

taking place at night during a rain storm  the movie has little or no depth

otherwise youll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface  for weeks  
then  predictably  their past comes back to haunt them  
it tries to make a heavyhanded point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment  with their only way out being crime  
thats why this will have a strong boxoffice initative from people who just want to see it  like me  but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it  
the question were asking is  when will they meet already   
jay has to be the comic  
the plot is as follows  after a terrifying incident  a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city

when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upsidedown martian tornado  which looks remarkably like a sandworm from  dune   destroying everything in its path  they just hang out watching  
she begins to sympathize with the grinch  who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic  
one question though  george wendt  
even a helpless puppy is run over  and we see his poor  little body flipping over and over under a truck  
a large part of hurlyburlys success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood  that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world  toys  playthings  
and thus the very setup for the film implodes  leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter  
the film  which wants to be beowolf  comes across more as a failed actionadventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels  
sure  the guys probably a nice guy in person  i actually found him very nonthreatening when he was on letterman not too long ago   
there was hardly any explosions or fights  
how do we know this is where she went

great design  good intentions  but no cigar  
even if youre not familiar with the video game  each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves  
although it doesnt stink like many of the similar films can  inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine  
sara claims to love him  but says if he forgets the wedding again shell stop loving him  a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has   
it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers  
of course split pea soup is the punch line  an overabundant amount  which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive  
the filler  instead of recounting his life  is supposed to be  as guccione claims  the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome  complete with orgies  vicious deaths  and lots of nudity  
the box for the film claims  because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture  parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18  
jack nicholson  chinatown 
a long  dull boot camp sequence follows  enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the  showgirls  directors camera roams over their buff bodies  
a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings  
all five of the girls have these  spicy  names for which they are better known than their real names  
it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it  and most of all  it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it  
as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki  a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski  
with the current level of writing and directing  nothing else about the film succeeds  
steven wright  tommy chong  janeane garofalo  willie nelson  snoop doggy dogg  and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another  
mercury rising adds to a growing list  including such stinkers as the jackal  last man standing  striking distance and the last boy scout  of stale actioners he has headlined  
the result is a mix of genres that dont mesh well  
when a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la  anaconda  or baseball players disappear into a  field of dreams  esque cornfield  theres really nothing to laugh at  
that makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life  
donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films  such as 1994s  the puppet masters   although i just watched him in the superb 1978 scifi classic  invasion of the body snatchers   where he was fabulous  
  wild wild west  is a beautifully filmed  well acted  and well directed piece of garbage  and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault

i would recommend that those who felt seasick at  the blair witch project  stay far away from  detroit rock city   because the witch has got nothing on this baby  
while robocop had a message about the importance of being human  and gave the bad guys some motivation  starship troopers lacks even these simple features  
once the audience catches on that this is the same story as  carrie   theres little to do but wait for the inevitable ending  
or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movies somber tone  
throughout the film  she is saved from answering any tough  sic   
the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke  
the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky  
he  like the others  does absolutely nothing unexpected  
at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel  and is expected to him on an adult level  since he is one  her teacher

this highlyanticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening  where it would have gone headtohead against the rival studios heavy hitters  its eventual demotion to a less potent midaugust opening was an obvious early indication of the studios lack of confidence with the picture

stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim  oz and kevin are forced to make awkward selfdiscoveries at arbitrary moments  none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see

lots of slime and reddyed corn syrup does not constitute  horror   in my opinion  
  and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro magnetic fields  no less  
but while there is wit in the words  this is a script which was probably much better on paper

for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like  mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from timetotime  but even the most exciting scenes  such as the one where art and simon are crouched down  avoiding passing trains  arent that pulsepounding

the tagline for  payback  is   get ready to root for the bad guy   and sure enough  this is true  as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way

but all of this doesnt matter since  virus  is basically just one loud  cluttered mess of a movie

and then when the girls parents walk in  blurts out  this must be your daughter  
also  the cast  consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars  including christopher knight  eve plumb  shannen doherty  and david leisure  was promising  
it sounds like a great plot  the actors are first grade  and the supporting cast is good aswell  and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance  
bill murray is slightly amusing in places  but fairly wasted  
well  what can really be said about this movie  there is very little discernible plot  
lets just blow stuff up  
in addition  many of the sequences have irritating  grainy film quality  which makes it feel lowbudget  the last scene is particularly bad   
the point becomes totally extraneous  
but that didnt work for the strangling scenes  
theres a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady  
instead of raising questions about existence  it raises boredom  
it even shows them in bed together  
little known facts about this film and its stars   threes company  fans alert

he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman  using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations  italians  french canadians and iranians

thanks to jeffrey kimballs polished  kinetic cinematography  wild things always looks great  and george s  clintons score keeps it pulsing and throbbing  
i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row  following hideaway and nine months

living with a pair of surfer dudes in a small  rented house  edison bounces from job to job  always squandering away the money on his eccentric  to say the least  inventions and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent

thats what director garry marshall  screenwriter gina wendkos and  not to be outdone  producer whitney houston have done with the grated disney film  the princess diaries

yes  the sets and costumes were an interesting exaggeration of 60s pop frills  and yes  the concept  dealing with a 60s secret agentpop icon  played by myers  awakened from his cryogenic slumber to battle his arch enemy  dr

instead you get woo  
not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit  eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears  
so   the odd couple ii   i  e  
its not love at first sight  however  
   
additionally that one side isnt even entertaining  the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness  
the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr  smith  oldman   the cartoony villain  and his plans for sabotage  
despite its lurid subject matter and its passing nod to fatal attraction  it moves along with flat  uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film  
this turkey  ultimately  isnt awful  but its not particularly interesting or unique either  
but there are some things that are interesting  
marcus ray  van damme   a babemagnet and stylish dresser  heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner  rob schneider   
while the novel is largely complex in characterization  the film sadly transposes conrads characters into lacklustre leads  the most disappointing being heyst himself  
isnt this just so  so  funny   
ironic selfreflection aside  parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because theres at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume  
besides being a terrible movie  the bachelor is well a terrible movie  
paul verhoevens last movie  showgirls  had a bad script  bad acting  and a  plot   i use the word in its loosest possible sense  that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity  
i come to the sw franchise as a stranger  since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular  
alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer  the babysitter

after a quick makeover  fern is transformed into vylette  the beautiful  new girl  at school  and a fullfledged member of the popular crowd  
theres a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences    weve 
while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past  the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating  shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery  
there is the happily ineffectual lawman  bruce dern   the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses affections  karina lombard   the barkeep who becomes our antiheros only friend  william sanderson   suspicious lieutenants  christopher walken and michael imperioli  to question the bosses trust in smith  a brutal beating  and a big fire

big mommas house is the definition of a  gimmick  movie if there ever was one  
hav tells the camera  but the problem is that its not outrageous at all or even the least bit interesting  
its dull  interminable  and unrelenting in its stupidity  
of course she doesnt tell him that she found his letter  she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later  preferably right after they first make love   
but still  that somehow doesnt justify the actions of the movies main characters  
its a love it or hate it film  
you have been warned  
one of the latter set   the wedding singer   seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980s directly but only read about them in an article in parade magazine  
no one is twisting nomis arm  
dr  alan grant  sam neill   jurassic park   is becoming disillusioned  
one of the oldest maxims of filmgoing is  beware of movies that use the authors name in the title   
means so f    ing earnest  
its not entertaining  nor exciting  or even action packed  
hes only onscreen long enough to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film and then he disappears  
ultimately  this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit  
  what does this scene do  
i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far  portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood badguys  
it doesnt look that way  
its a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets  which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce  
or at least the lack of inspiration  
question about god by the bell  as it rings to end the class  
peoples says that this is not a  blade runner  sequel  but a  sidequel  that takes place in the same universe  
even prequel  summer  lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neato shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh  
so  basically  what you have is this  
convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant  seth decides to break his  and sets out to turn every  thou shalt not  of the ten commandments into a  thou shalt   and vice versa   
now for the bad news  
moresco  a theater guy and sometimes tv writer  including the series falcone   obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child  but the content is probably too personal  
 the only laugh in the film   as a wild drunkard  whos big moment is a dance he does at a critical time  
fourth  and  unfortunately  not the final  installment in the death wish series  will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group  production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade  
or  mommy fearest   
the plot is pretty much what we expect  the big dinosaurlike creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city  and its up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped  while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down  
in his directorial debut  steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion  
then theres minime  verne troyer   a    
here  his bravado basically turns into bullyness  
finally  rosanna arquette is awful as sophie  but something tells me that was her purpose  and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time  
constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita  molly shannon  and her amicable superior  gus  john c  reilly   
so i guess  even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons  
it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby  
despite its limited appeal  blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series  
  flubber   as you probably know  is a remake of the disney classic i never saw   the absent minded professor   where a  well  absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as  flubber   you know  flying rubber  
in any case  this is a criticproof film  and will in all probability do well in the box office  as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into  
tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves cause theyve had hits  major or minor  
in this respect  the film never disappointed me  
i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate  
nothing is difficult  plausible  or believable in any of the angels actions  
the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual ruletheworld so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s  but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin  francisco scaramanga  christopher lee  putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie  who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moores 007  
where is the u  n   
duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks  and i kept wishing for a fastforward button to move their scenes along  
she disapproves of him  and he of her   but is powerless to do anything about it  
its rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one  
the actors do their best  but are hamstrung by the weak material  
emmerich did do one thing  though  
if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world  why couldnt verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers  grunts  and other sounds during the dance numbers  
  the doom generation  is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them  and also as another  teen angst  film  one of the slogans is  teen is a fourletter word   hardy har har   
sure the headless horseman is an intriguing character  but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster  
we can  in some films  fill the textual gaps ourselves  but that almost never happens in an american film  
yes  this is a bad film  easily one of the most incompetent films of the year  but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure  
rest assured  the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity  but it is thoroughly violent  especially toward women  
joel schumacher has directed the film with no flair  
in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba  even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligentand stallone is no lawrence olivier  
hes separated from his wife  serena  kathleen quinlan   and down to his last serious client    in a lowbudget film shooting in romania  
our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham as  where he is hoping for his big break  
when you shoot people from under their chins  they look like they have double chins

unfortunately  she may also be starting to understand that she understands  
how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres  
stevens wife is loaded  
this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked scifi film strange days  
starship troopers is a bad movie  
you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role  
this is just as well  
lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4  episode 1 is a boring  empty spectacle that features some nice special effects  
it features extraordinary animation  which is one good thing i can say about this film  
the main story is the independence of a worker named z  allen   
at any rate  this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies  none of which are funny  
and hes obi wan ke frigginnobi for gods sake  
during the film  somebody obviously became aware of that problem  so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris  
im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel  at least in my world where the sky is blue  
writerdirector lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s  
it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie  
the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr  in a fantasy sequence called cooks  a cops takeoff in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for  needy families  with the assistance of a fullyarmed swat team  of course   
on the other side of the wall  dobies troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like  actor delivers a stunning macbeth   actor courted by hollywood studio    actor renounces hollywood for priesthood   and  prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal   
however  i have my limits and i also have standards  
the connection between the two feels completely edited  so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan  you wonder how he recognized him so fast  
i didnt even finish the movie    
his looks get him a job as a busboy  and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender  where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous  
the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys hunt for valek  thomas ian griffith   a freaky marilyn mansontype whos on a mission that dates back 600 years  
humor for that matter  drama  suspense  or romance  
and of course  the much hyped collision of comet and earth  
my  extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock  
no  the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movies brutally squandered potential  the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise  even by tired serial killer genre standards  
the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them  
after all  its not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments  but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry  
theres no humor to be found anywhere in  tomb raider   even though it tries hard from time to time  
things go wrong  of course  
come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo    
this guy is  so  bad   how bad  is  he     
anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches  madonna  valeria golino  alicia witt  and ione skye   which was the worst one out of all of them  
nor does he bring anything newother than the localeto the material  
it doesnt get any better when the action scenes begin  
elle  the chiefs daughter  campbell   is bland personified  a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married  
perhaps economic content is a better wordit certainly doesnt show capitalism in a good light  
there is not much to say about the performances in the film  
well  it just doesnt work  in fact  zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this   
a suave  cool  collected  rich  uptight bad guy  cliche  
anyway  finn does the convict a good deed  just to show that hes a really swell guy  
she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa  
the movie starts off in the 1950s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth  
okay  it did suck  
unfortunately  that is not the case here  where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying  giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights  and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits  
he even has one scene that  though it also tries to sicken the audience  has a honestly tense feel to it  the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space   
the movie is insulting to horror film fans and teenagers  
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention  
he is living happily in england  enjoying the benefits of being a landowning noble  
i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  
theres a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something thats artistically good  
i wanted to like this film more than i did  
inexplicably  leftys horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us  
whats worse  after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats  we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction  veers off in another  then another  and ends up being totally incomprehensible  
not much room for social commentary there  
all of whom are very good  just hamstrung by really  really  lousy material  
she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character  its apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain  she must be a cartoonish  bumbling nerd   
its dialog is so stilted   you know what they say  no women  no cry    
watching the film  i couldnt help but notice its similarities with 1997s far  far superior film  the sweet hereafter   which dealt with a lawyer  played brilliantly by ian holm  investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children  
oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband  bruce greenwood  who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man  
the movie is  of course  a liveaction version of the beloved childrens book  which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones  
the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again and again  sometimes from a different perspective and sometimes not  
and his kid distrusts him because hes never around  
in addition  we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson  and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies  
jeez  
commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton  whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful  
the alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic  home alone  with puppies  and not much else  
odd couple ii feels terribly generic  where in the first movie  made thirty one years ago  feels like a wonderful tale  
todays joe young is designed and produced by specialeffects whiz rick baker  who has been wowing audiences with his stateoftheart makeup effects since 1971s  schlock   which  incidentally  featured a bakerenhanced  gorilla    
the film has no style of individuality  
caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man  
whats really amazing is that the filmmakers were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie  
questions asked  
no explanation of this should be necessary  
in fact  even bigger names like mohr  wolf  and katie holmes dont have enough time to make substantial success  
youve got to work pretty hard  actually  to not get an audience to become involved in the parents plight  since their children are dead  but that is exactly what  a civil action  does  
nonspoiler  incidentally  the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times  usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin  
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window  he seeks comfort in a stranger  tyler  pitt  whom he met on a flight home  
  its just    
important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film  these landmarks serve as the films little conflict  
the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure  then the after math  the morning after  of such events

after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer  he hinted at a bit growth in last years cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance  though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark  precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart  presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans  and start bellyaching about how hed fallen for his  target

the whole film is like this  and its basically nothing but a headache  
also  there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons  or getting caught up in the movies tension

so  they start picking men  and are left without 1  thus ahmed is choosen  
and at the end of the whole clich  d ordeal  the nicest thing you could possibly say would be      
and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie  
bill  too  is seen arminarm with a couple of models before hes pulled away to deal with an overdoser  
consistent with this ethic  liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives  
the bats are all sleeping  but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out  
still  its slightly amusing parts are longed for when the movie gets bogged down in sappy moments  
the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang  
apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average moviegoer  considering that the film has pulled in over 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone  
ditto for the editing  which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant  
why has he done this  you ask  
the first half of the film is about the young mans plan to win her back  
it belongs back on the shelf  
i found myself rather bored with this film  which will disappoint both scifihorror fans and fans of henstridge and lambert  
is that exciting or what  
having jolies real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier  
halfway through young einstein  i knew for sure the movie was a stinker  
isnt it scary enough that theyre like this  and cant the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them  not that you could be next to die  
what they dont realise is that the planes pilot was also a drug dealer  and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latters erstwhile colleagues  
its not  however  hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long  
the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people  these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless  
nope  not by a long shot  
she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible  soontobecommitted crimes  but neither her hohum husband  aidan quinn  nor the hohummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously  
the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims  or so it seems  
thats a huge problem  since the four main characters are supposed to be couples  
it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers  
big daddy is really nothing special  and is not even worth it for a few chuckles  
  mimic  has a lot of incidental shock tactics  boo  
thats why he feels like a plot device  
after a hiatus of about fifteen years  the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest  
all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters  one of whom  scott silver  is also the director  
hey  tis the season  
he attacks the kingdom of ehdan and kills young prince talons parents  
so  the audience must wait  if they havent already stopped watching  as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawnout finale  
hip  cool  demonic auctioneer nick  the zone  falzone  cusack  is the best in the biz  
annie  sandra bullock  is in the wrong place at the wrong time again  
of course  not everything goes entirely to plan  
i think they cut this too short  
she was never really made into anything  until she met an indian towards the end  developing yet another subplot  
so i stayed  
i found this scene offensive  
he did  however  have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film  and then decided to actually take the time to write it out  
so when he asked to direct his first movie  based on his first ever script written  everyone and their grandma said  sure  go for it    
marsden is  as i said  bland  thought not particularly bad   
instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddycop movie  think cop and a half    with a twist   
this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo  a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown  though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it  
he has much in common with chris tucker  rush hour  money talks  in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips  
he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued  almost nostalgic performance  when needed  
what are the implications of this  
whos next  
sands temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally  big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangsters womanfriend claire  angelina jolie   this films babe factor  
all of the movies funny scenes were included in the ad  
if you remember bob hope specials with fondness  this might be your cup of tea  
  mandingo  is satisfied to simply show some skin  and because of that  its  trashy potboiler  nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished  
what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie  
this movie is so bad that people in the audience were laughing  chortling at the bad acting and crummy dialog  
it has its moments  a scene in which jones body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining   but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour  
his major stylistic failing is that he cant seem to direct an action scene  and the quick  nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie  
soon  it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff  but the question comes down to why  and  of course  who  
it seems to ben that no matter what he does  paul vitti will not go away  and the more they become involved  the more bens potentially happy life gets into danger  
thats until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually  like linda tripp  
the story is told from harrys point of view  
for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking  or whats left of it in mainstream hollywood  movie which are star vehicles are terrible things  
the community  protected by an overworked dam  is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloudchoked skies  
theres considerable sexual tension between travis and libby  hey  theres something  the fugitive  didnt have    but it never goes anywhere  
the battle scenes  although well choreographed  are not involving and not the least bit exciting  
we expect these events  
though i suppose his hookhand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit  
but where gooding was once an exciting actor  he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous  
i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene  they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart  
he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career  
when claire finally comes facetoface with our evil murderer  robert downey jr    it turns out his name is vivian  hes clairvoyant and hes got some major issues with mama  a la norman bates  
it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with  
it does have a few good scenes  therons superorgasmic model character is kind of funny  and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two  
the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts  
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as  whats it all about  
now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good  nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise  
most importantly  it allows the navigators of the spacing guild  once human but now hideously mutated  to  fold space  and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously  enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish  
  aside  club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasnt changed in the future   
director rob cohen  dragon  the bruce lee story  has made a big  expensive movie that  while ambitiously plotted  is both murky and predictable  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever  
thats what the press materials for the film probably say  
big deal  weve seen it all before  
it follows the girls as they travel here and there  culminating at their  first live performance  at albert hall  
in that order  knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense  
joe is restless at first  no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l  a   plotting joes demise  
plot  set in the future  a courier has uploaded some data into a  hard drive  that resides in his head  and must now escape the bad guys who are after that very important information  
aaaaaaaaah  
the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult  
kevin smith has now made two satisfying films  clerks and chasing amy  
but dont do that with a movie with the potential of this one  
they are nothing more than potential recipients of overactive  raging hormones  
its pretty good  and they have a song about annie  who commits suicide  
  0  4 to 4  minor spoilers in this review  
but cool sight  
in my opinion  a movie reviewers most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion  
one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project  
like so many thrillers these days  including  the usual suspects  and  the game    wild things  eschews character for plot  
the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride  and its sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics  both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the years finest films  
if only the sordidness were the worst of the generals daughters problems  
he  though selfrighteous as ever  cant help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly  quietly  develop affections for each other  
theyve got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all  
as a med student  patchs antics at the schools hospital catch the attention of his soon to be archenemy  straightlaced dean walcott  bob gunton   
movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting  entertaining or convincing  because of one fundamental reason  movies are made by adults and not teenagers  
the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best  
the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast  and it doesnt really fit into a movie mold  
this revelation exists purely for its own sake  
these are but a couple of the ridiculous examples of product placement scattered throughout the film  
this    
melancholic  yes  
in general  i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use  
okay  so maybe im being a little too nice  
all of it is cribbed from other films  and in most cases  better films   
it lurches from sports movie to amishmocking to roadtrip to sentimental melodrama   pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal  and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack   never quite getting it all together  
coppola is an executive producer for  sleepy hollow   and the script reflects his interest in early forms of  moving pictures   particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion  
on one level   return to horror high  is a slasher movie  and it is at this level that it works the best on  
being a goodnatured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice  but  other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull  what did babe actually do  
but we can only hope  
or are there simply no rules in war  
roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given  which unfortunately isnt much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie  
nor will you care  
something holds him back  
pass on by  
however  dont go to this film looking for any new insights into autism  not that many people will   
well  because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility  
the direction is poor and there is little continuity  not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly  
bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie  
its another bloody showdown  complete with cliffhanger ending  
i understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans  but i really don  t see it  
its a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety  
most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk  
the film opens in postrevolutionary france in 1871  the 16yearold rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems  
well yeah i can  its not funny  
to start the  story  it is four years later  and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be  now a priest played by richard burton  is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan  and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again  maybe she was good or something   
the cash register rings up  6  66  
i couldnt believe how bad this scene was  the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect  ahem    
street fighter  the movie  1995  starring  raul julia and jean claude vandamme 
if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie  its that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywoodtypes known to man  
but it wasnt  schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best  
things work out in a ridiculous way  where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace  where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood  
indeed with a script like that  you could make a wonderful parody  but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously  attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller  
jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today  
there is also an underdeveloped subplot about a band of incompetent underground veggie fanatics  called trogolodistes  who have been summoned to rescue the clown and steal some grain  
as it is  the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes  and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane  
broderick is invaluable to the government  
not recommended for kids  teens  or anyone else  
the characters are onedimensional and uninteresting  
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing  
granted  there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of preschool humor  but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle  
sure  he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease  
in a later scene  as misfit brother kip knowingly tells memphis he has the stolen car situation under control  all the while making breakfast  a metaphor is made of shakespearean proportions  
potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring  
how did this creature come into existence  and why does it feed on hormones  
starting with a burglary of franciss flat  the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie  
dirty old sod   
cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price  
budget  de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror  
everything revolving around bats is tired drivel  which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up  
when fuelled by don davis loud  driving music score  the films many fights become almost passable  but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves  
in life  eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison  
  smashing   
as the movie opens  zachs wife  alex  catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress hairdresser  
couldnt he have used the money saved by only having to pay half a dozen actors to hire a scriptwriter  
she dies  the perps  
rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona  though  leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs  
for those of us who havent read the james lee burke novel that heavens prisoners is based on  do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts  feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps  gangsters with louisiana accents  plots  subplots  more plots  and well  really just want to see teri hatcher naked  this is one movie youre going to worry the price of admission over  
to be honest  i couldnt care less if snipes character got captured or not  
levison cant handle his own plot  
well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer  and is now an outlaw  kidnapping a chinese woman with him  and having her help him along the way  
once again  its up to ace to save the day  using his uncanny detective skills  
tingle  but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident  
the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano  sudden death   horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth  and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers  the wedding planner  to deliver his mousy self as a leader  
and so  yada yada yada  they reveal the comet to the public and their plans  send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive  
in spite of the provocative title  the story is cliched and overly familiar  
didnt they read the bad dialogue  the cheezy lines  the obvious derivative nature of the work  mind you  with a director like depalma at the helm  that aint saying much    
theres no snap to make the film work  it moves at a plod  
soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and  if not returned in four days  will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other  
directed by terry gilliam 
from the writerdirector of  blue velvet  and  twin peaks  comes another dark  mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive  the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills  
the character development was not up to par either  i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child  
as is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth  alan rickman  and prunella scales  
its as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek  
we never get inside them  never feel sympathetic to them  because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland  
during the film  i often found myself asking the questions   is there a reason to this  
even when  as an adult  finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor  reacquaints himself with estella  and draws her portrait in the nude  theres nothing  
the result is a picture of confounding badness  a kiddieporn mess that thinks its really deep and profound  
we already know what to look for  so why should we be surprised  
the  hook  that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic  
araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme  hell make some kind of art  
oh sure  hell be really impressive when the bad guys come calling  
together  they save the day from evil  
while stallone still carries his own weight here  the movie lacks what the original did as well  purpose  
the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours  therefore coming off like a two hour skit  
he races off to mail the information  but is killed in a reckless car accident  
someone regurgitate halfdigested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms  people  the screen  and ultimately  the audience  
the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads  
  and 
some of them are believable and some unbelievable    for 
its usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience  who dont seem to mind participating in a mass  mystery science theater 3000  type viewing  
theres enough blood  gore  simulated sex  and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring  
annie is something of a psychic  she has involuntary bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions  
theres also a considerable language barrier  given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents  
just how long  can  they keep a straight face  
movies based on video games  such as street fighter or mario bros   have never generated much interest at the box office  
maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story  
baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet  
schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max  who falls in love with his best friend jay  lee  s book editor samantha  avital  a mere twentyfour hours after meeting her  
its full of genuine laughs and wont leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes  as  analyze this  did  
instead  carrey just mugs away  playing for the camera even when most of it isnt funny  
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible  
in fact  there isnt even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105minute running time  
earlier i mentioned a fullyclothed handjob  this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont  both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie  
umm    
while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives  the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if its funny  
those two lines marked the high points of this film  
theres a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit  takehiro murata  and a slimy government official  hiroshi abe  over the handling of godzilla  and personal issues  
the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m  bison  raul julia   
some people die  theres blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense  
but enough of this stuff about plot and character  right  
full of metaphorical interpretations  the films best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom  
it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler  who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam  
after seeing it  i think the words in my recent  antz  review  in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995s  the pebble and the penguin   were a bit premature  
it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed  which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail  
the one good tomato in grocery  by virtue of a miracle   must have fallen off the truck to toronto   
second  it was  perhaps  the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act  
to which i would have answered   if i knew  then the movie would already be over    
this is a standard practice in anime  or at least the half dozen or so titles that i  ve seen  
there is zero humor  zero suspense  zero drama and zero action  until the last ten minutes  when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence  
based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson  what dreams may come is clunky  manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar  
when one is found in the middle of nowhere  1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean  norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee  
based in central london  this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert  suzanne danielle  to bed her husband emile the french ambassador  kenneth williams   
all of a sudden  with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse  the doors swing open to reveal whats inside  
sadly  as the picture progresses  the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up  twohour long episode of magyuver  
shes the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role  taking the rebellingagainstdaddy character to at least a passing grade  
at home  welles is a family man  with a wife  catherine keener  and a small daughter to take care of  
max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love  lillianna  who hasnt seen him since he was a normalsized kid  
but ill begin from the beginning  
however  when he arrives at the trap  both hit men miss  how convenient  and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away  
  in the fights  each of the characters does at least  one  thing they do in the game  and often more   
the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi  who plays the resident crazy man  ultimately being the only thing worth watching  
at the end of an action scene in  lara croft  tomb raider   a wall collapses near the nubile warrior  
arnold schwarzenegger  still recovering from heart problems and  batman  robin   plays an excop turned security agent or bodyguard or something  
needless  dumb sequel flopped in the box office  and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time  to which i agree with  
  the siege  is constantly heavyhanded  not entertaining or insightful  and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay  
watchers has all three devices  which may explain why its arguably the most popular of koontzs books  
you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast  
billed as a gay bonnie and clyde  this gritty film from director marcelo pi  eyro has its only highlight in a welldesigned title sequence  
it is the cinematic equivalent to jello  pretty to look at  but empty  
a few months later  volcano was released  
how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo  the slacker duo of kevin smith movies   akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny  
and gordy  
but anyway  the actors do as much as they can with what they are given  
the grand  angelic perspective gets lost  except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angels eyes  
that your most meaningful relationships are being formed on the net  
laughter is supposed to arise from the comical events  but never does  
the day before the boat trip  joe meets one of graynamores daughters  
he was even better in caddyshack  for crying out loud  
upham in saving private ryan  
but when you put him in front of a camera  it just isnt the same  
  its okay   she gasps   i got to have you   
many other films  though  have equal  if not superior  special effects and are much better  
unfortunately  the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill  he looks very sick here   and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers  the book  
it is  in short  one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks  or anybody else  produce  
if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously  it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film  
undoubtably uma thurmans entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy  
even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his  holy men    
rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness  
so  the people who  like the author of this review  grew up watching flintstones  popular 1960s animated series about  modern stone age  family  werent particularly worried when the word came about live action remake  
aliens sans flamethrowers  
the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough  but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate  
  42196   12997   61397  see also   babe   
director paul anderson  who helmed last years icy thriller  event horizon  doesnt show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam  
nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim  
and believe me  im not giving anything away by saying that sandlers team wins  
rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner  a wouldbe comedy which quickly proves to be tedious  unfunny  and unengaging  
and  although i hate to say it  a different director would have been the biggest improvement  
the knicks continue to lose  but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops  
the couples relationship develops too hastily  leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant showandtell approach  
it certainly didnt bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the socalled father of modern poetry  
synopsis  valerie  a high school junior who doesnt look a day under 22  writes bad poetry  complains about how much she hates school  fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women  chooses him as a pen pal  and plays hooky to see him in court  
in spite of the secrecy  wigands former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role  
david spade is not the problem with lost and found  
thats an exaggeration  but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the film  
while the animation is certainly colorful to look at  osmosis jones story is a hackneyed one  
ho ho ho  
but here  ventura is made to look a lot stupider  and is often made out as the straight guya role which is definitely not carreys style  
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity  unaware that his car is in neutral  
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild  sympathetic  or even ineffectual character roles  
when i originally saw the trailer for  analyze this  a few months ago  i must admit  i thought it looked kind of lame  
the one exception would be tcheky karyo  la femme nikita  as dunois  the man who was leading the attack prior to joans arrival  
as it stands  superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission  
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 1 on the 4 to 4 scale  
eddie murphy plays g  a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message  
but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess  
jacksons mother martha  lange  runs kilronan all by herself  and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately  even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether  caught redhanded after a bedroom romp with her husbandtobe  
rated r  contains violence  profanity  and brief nudity   
elements of each of these genres exist in the film  yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them

and lets face it  probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zetajones  
the tone is terrible and the banter is worse  
everyone else will see end of days for what it is  a deliciously bad motion picture  
here  phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard  his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his  look here  see  glory  
treat williams is a passable hero  and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation

verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage  but the fauxjingoistic scenes of children  doing their part for the war effort  by squishing roaches on a sidewalk arent enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck  
we get an endless parade of quickcuts  splitscreens  zoomouts  zoomins  and rotating cameras  all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script

note  the following reveals the basic plot  
the script  by bayard johnson and j  anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come  
along the way to no discernable destination  they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters  
the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark

tarzan and the lost city  the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burroughs legendary hero to the big screen  is one of the most inept and illtimed of any tarzan adventure so far  
the weird  almost defiant lack of dialogue  there are no  no  conversations lasting over  say  20 seconds  undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters  
after they pay the manager onehundred bucks for three hookers  they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building

  meet joe black  is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year  with a cinematography  music and cast that will dazzle most of us

it pains me to write this  but scream 3s comedy is generally laughless  with the exception of welltimed performances by josh pais  as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in cravens music of the heart   jamie kennedy  resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2   and parker posey  through sheer force of will as a bactress   
any movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise  
the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man  john frankenheimer  
im no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy  
  why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film   
i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie  i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham   because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by  its hard to understand why the rights were optioned

rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized  
a crushing disappointment  the film is one of the worst outings of the year  too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad  too polished to overlook its deficiencies

a funny joke  
the movie degenerates into a crosscountry chase  where everything you expect to happen    
conrads heyst adheres religiously to his late fathers ways of detachment and isolation  
the screenplay is o  k  but theres some hackneyed subplot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street  again  and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched  
although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another  
i know its a stretch  after all it is a movie and nothing really happened  but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that  
this film was a bunch of fighting  yelling  special effects  and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack  
to provide video footage  he films his children dressed in native garb  
sleep in  
absolute power  the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood  attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff

umm  moving right along    
did we attend the same movie   
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively  
they cannot have it both ways  
while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed  the film remains flat and uninvolving  
amazingly  aside from gilbert gottfrieds 90 seconds of screen time  there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner  
philips warns  
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain  
there are some broken hoop dreams  some wannaseehowfasticandrives  and then the ultimate showdown  was that my wife i saw you with last night

if youre not asleep within the first half hour  consult your doctor  
if violence is supposed to be shocking  its not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb  
the review  main problem first  about 2 of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work  
  from the begining hes our hero and this doesnt work  
but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office  
how bad is this movie  
in the acting department  the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down  
one of the best examples that hollywood now completely ignore these qualities is found in the new film where the heart is  
the jokes and puns are lame  osmosis searches out a snitch  a former flu virus  
that in itself is forgivable  hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages  
the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance  
depending on your degree of cinematic acumen  last man standing is either a  a prohibitionera remake of akira kurosawas 1961 classic yojimbo  b  a prohibitionera remake of sergio leones 1964 classic a fistful of dollars  c  a prohibitionera action drama with a completely original storyline  
     amazing  potent stuff  
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay  
i admit  im an avid fan of the mortal kombat series  
though the blurb alludes to  a jungle filled with political intrigue  uneasy alliances  and murderous enemies at every turn   the story of the movie is actually quite simple  and prosaic   a middleaged japanese businessman named endo  played by john fujioka  and his assistant  both of whom have samurai aspirations  travel to africa in search of his ancestor  who went to bring buddhism to africa  
youd think that the director  dean semler  a former cinematographer  would at least produce a film with interesting visuals  
they arent real people  theyre a writers construct stumbling through a tooobvious storyline  
they dont find it  
somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value  
we are introduced to jackson  johnathon schaech  last encounter in tom hanks that thing you do   and helen  gwyneth paltrow   a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love  
the movies stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material  
one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair  
its the story that needs some major work  
a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on maxs struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammys struggles to get money and become a better person  
added to the sound problems was the cinematography  
with about half an hour to go  a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama  
virus is a truly dumb action thriller  one of negligible intelligence and innovation  
also  williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs  tingle  which is also loosely based on the book  killing mr  griffin  by the writer of i know what you did last summer  7  510   
owens replies   a male  sir   
  will smith  do your own thing    and 
the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff  drawing  as with his other films  elements from the hotter films of the year  eg  se7en   
 a twisted priest  charles huevelman  hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana  angela zimmerly  looks on uninterested  
sadly  its also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if its presented right  
its manipulating to hurt  or kill  young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante  
she may give a stronger performance than  say  keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds  by not by much  
perhaps because he knows this is his last goround in the part that made him a legend  shatner looks like hes having the time of his life  stewart  on the other hand  borders on the deferrential  and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast  
the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews  but  ironically  i have barely scratched the surface  
gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the films end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic  going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone    this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer  
the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is  
this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion  
critique  ive been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now  but hold on to your brooms and incantations  cause this puppy is far from being it  
it aims to  inspire  rather than to touch hearts

there are so many flaws in double jeopardy  it is laughable  
the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick  
did they owe the director a favor or something  
if you dont buy this explanation  youre not alone  
the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals  
or at least somewhere up there

1 and 1  
i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening    
the problem is the script  or more accurately  shakespeares original text  
this is a star oriented film  and the star who carries the film is erin  hope davis   
its obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe  
its convoluted and silly at the same time  
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space  
an interesting premise of loser comic book characters  
i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  
kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer  7  510   
youll wince  youll groan  youll grouse   havent we seen this guy killed twice before

  scream 3  has three official websites that  wink  wink  pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie  
partly flight of fancy  partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry  gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo  
its really hard to find comparisons to such an experience  and i know that ive never said that before  i thought i never would   but  lost in space  is actually better  
nice try  though  
theres no thought  no development  no plot  just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to genxers

even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes  do proceed at your own risk  
kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film  many of the scenes have a similar tone  and there are moments in frears film that kumble imitates almost completely  such as the last scene  in which spoiler warning   the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers

most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy  since phillips absentmindedness is forgotten about  and somehow push the story along

these bright moments  however  appear long and far between  and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria  which is both painfully predictable and bythenumbers  
also  romeo must die  must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film  and that is an xray effect that appears three times during the course of the film  showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent

i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored  or a new theme is examined  or a special effects shot isnt used

i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie  
heres a concept  jeanclaude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie  
denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the scandal plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent thats made the kennedy family so popular  
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse  
then theres leslie nielsen  who looks  sounds  and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character  memorably voiced by jim backus   
too bad  
hysterically funny  actually

it reads a lot like a fifth book of gullivers travels

his attempt to go behind the scenes of las vegas  and as he put it  show the naked truth   is simplified and unreal  
this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent  and even then prepare for disappointment

in the slightly contrived opening scenes  we witness his heroism in action  as he  and his mentor  played by scott glenn  attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire  
the difference between the two is that in the latter  things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality  
i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity  
frankly  while the special effects are competent  theyre not all that stunning  
another pathetic element of the film was the script

this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element  which is solely a creation of hollywood  seems to hold to the original novel  
desperate to make his dream come through  ray goes to a loanshark  humorously and menacingly played by james e  moriarty  and borrows 10 grand to bet on a  sure thing  at freehold raceway  
but he doesnt  so you get the sense that hes not only irresponsible  but also pretty dumb  
not that there is much of a romance to begin with  
in days  he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling  loincloth wearing  rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts  
was i grossed out  
its a scary notion for jimmy  even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne  renee zellweger   his girlfriend of three years

this is an absolute lie

so i went and saw this film right  it was called  battlefield  earth   i was never interested in the previews  and never too terribly interested in the book  nor do i find scientology interesting  but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is  i had that weird urge just to watch it

well  if youre a super smart biomolecular research scientist working for the military  youd grope a coworker and roughup your neighbor from across the street  
this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending  but most is lost  
any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device

a year passes  and nothing is heard about it again  
how fast  
the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise  the buzz around it had been soso  and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes  all leading you to believe that its actually going to go  somewhere   
liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about whats going on as the rest of them do  
since he overloaded his  hard drive   hes also racing against the clock before the information seeps into his brain and kills him

his partner bo derek  on the other hand  shows that she didnt age enough to cease being the sex goddess  but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents  
this movie proves what  starship troopers  only hinted at  he cannot act  but he sure looks wellgroomed  even in the deepest heart of the african jungle

almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities  
i could go on longer  but i dont want to  ruin  the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on

when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club  it should be a euphoric height  for her  the crowd  and the audience  however  the moment doesnt get a chance to reach that level  for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality  which also mars the films conclusion  one of the lastminute reshoots

much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyds selfserving vanity project  but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this  none of the excitement is passed on to the audience  
van damme is bad  but hes charming in that bad way  and so i cant say that hes hard to watch  although i rarely understood what he was saying

i always consider it an index of a movies desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events  and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact  
what it is  however  is a series of increasingly improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists  
sandra bullock  who is a good actress but not a serious one  looks clueless  spaceys accent switches itself on and off at random  and hes given a totally thankless role to play as well  a role without an iota of depth   and mcconaugheys role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box  
unfortunately  with so much going on  youre not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about  
nothing in this movie makes sense  
biel cries a lot  while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her classconscious father  
it is only a video game  after all  but the onscreen version tries to go beyond its comic book boundaries by adding depth  a conceptualization of selfworth  and worst of all  a love story  
   
we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone  only how they felt about things that didnt even happen yet

the  stockaitkenwaterman of hollywood movies have projected their artform  into ridiculity  beyond the plane believability  where people still  accept even if they didnt believe  
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film  as it stands  it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand

it is unfortunate that this film  even with its surprisingly strong box office has succeeded in doing what warners thought tim burton would do with the franchise  
lets talk about the movie itself  
along the way  the merry band meets mrs  delores bickerman  betty white   a weird old lady who lives out on the lake  
late in the movie  jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey  kim dickens  who he meets at a coffee shop  
the phone rings  its a sinistersounding man  claiming to be his doctor  telling him to flee for his life  
one thing  he has to go up against  terl  the chief of security psychlo  who is played frankly  quite bad by john travolta  whom with dreadlocks  a big head  and green eyes just doesnt work  
also  apparently  the weather changes quickly in their locale  theyre at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex  the next day  theyre out playing in the snow before having sex  
ugh  
this is your definitive  hollywood  movie  extremely predictable  following the basic formula  a horrible ending   overzealous writing  meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting  therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space  and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wiseass character  of which weve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly  wasnt used enough here   im afraid the film would have been completely unbearable  
seagal plays jack taggert  an aikidoversed  fighting machine  who is an agent with the epa  
when critics attack seemingly wellintentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do  their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry emails  sometimes even mock death threats from those who  i suppose  like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment  
the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets  
while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character  u  s marshals is straight in there  pulling its trump card  the place crash  almost immediately  
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in  
she was cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it  
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnutsexcept for the animated stuffed rats

the original benefited from what looked to be carreys constant hypedup improv sequences  which were hysterically funny

the music  finally  assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue  
the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur millers name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play  
paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneiders cia superior  and lela rochon  playing an investigator for the jeans company  spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode  
tis a pity    
as a piece of storytelling  then  mca tvs version of dune is clearly superior  
i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed  at times  to be played for laughs  
in fact  most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight  
except for the bit at the used car lot  and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers   the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call  
all these bit players put forth more effort than the series returning stars  who are probably saving their energy for the long post  scream  job search

   the following review contains spoilers

my biggest problem with this film was its tendency to put these two snipers in as  many  inchesfromdeath situations as possible

composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds  turning seths sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark  quinns performance as seth is all wildeyed fervor without any genuine pain  
and how  you may ask  
trust me  
and with good reason  
if youre going to use slapstick like that  use it up on pee wee herman  
it is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film  
someone could have used an editor  
the acting is at best flat  except for mr  connery  
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community  
faye dunaway plays charles overbearing motherinlaw  and dustin hoffman appears over twohours into the story as a character dubbed  the conscience  
no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age  we want bad asses today  
mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory  
as far as plots go  its a pretty thin and tired one

not only is it hokey  but you dont care about any character  
see it twice  
character problems abound  rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre  the latter of which is not  at least at this point  something ben affleck is capable of pulling off  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
it appears to be telling them   hey  it doesnt matter if youre happy the way you are  
presented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged  it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme  
what results is a film that looks good  but like that one scene  just isnt right  
the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue  but at other times its rough  
stripes isnt the playful kind of sex comedy  either  
and not intelligent because it lacks a story  
and since it doesnt quite work as a comedy  it tries to fall back on the action  which also fails  
it is a rare thing for a childrens movie to be praised this highly  so wouldnt you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly  magical  piece of work  
part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever  
by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentices relation ship  or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them  prentice for example  doesnt seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fightpicking  beerdrinking  macho kind of guy  and kim  for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film   and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story  the film manages to lobotomise itself  
but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening  
while his speech still ends up objectifying women  it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie  
like the rest of the movie  
the best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed  they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set  
the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page  goldberg  and sting  
and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target  beautiful  wealthy brandi web  played nicely by whitfield  who runs a successful real estate business  is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia  king   i found myself thinking   im supposed to feel sorry for this guy

fragile nell  taylor   bisexual theo  zetajones   and smiley luke  wilson  are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders  hosted by professor marrow  neeson   
years ago  movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient  secondclass people  good for being only maids and servants  
this is a pretty bad horror film  yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining  and house on haunted hill is just such a film  
both films are modeled on dantes  the inferno   of course   8mm  makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil  
childers does what he has to do  evacuate the family and protect the men under his command  
its a one note concept  
the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films  
we live the adventure along with the protagonist  reacting to each twist and turn  
for example  our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos  
not  surprising since michael bay is a child of that industry and has  actually managed to transpose his mtv skills to screen successfully  
stopping off in a flophouse motel  richie rapes and slaughters the hostage  
take  for instance  how our heroes move around  
youd think phillipe  and del toro are  going to pull out guns and scare them away but they dont  instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob  
  the kid is good   he must have said  
i suppose thats what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole  
13 halfhour episodes certainly hadnt exhausted all possible situations

should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again  
1  the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff  wcw president who thought up this project  thinks of wrestling fans  
well throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc  e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo  and then he can feel guilty   
adam sandler isnt known for appearing in deep  thoughtprovoking films  but hes still a really funny guy  
the fulloflife student fights stodgy establishment types  
he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice  and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny  
key word here   supposed   
at least with that  movie   you dont have to go through the painful experience of watching pamela try to pronounce multiple syllable words like  eclectic   
  the blair witch project  was a rare triumph of style over substance  
animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe inducing robots youve endured at disney world  
its difficult to find anything in the film that does work  
in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film  
she just isnt convincing in this film  and she wasnt in the original either   
his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database  
were provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent  
its a great moral  with a great cast  just not much substance to back it up  
well now i know  
it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion  
bottom line  if you want to see antonio swing his sword  rent  the mask of zorro   
i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that theres something rotten in the state of teen angstdom  
the film that im talking about is a night at the roxbury   one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit  
peppers is one to examine  
one of the actresses cast as branaghs lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling  a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner  710   
everything plays out just as one would think  heavy on predictability  light on an actual story  
at the very least   end of days  should have done us the courtesy of being badenoughtobegood  but it cant even manage that  
if you can sneak into the theater without paying  go for it  
its tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass  but his performance actually helps with the illusion  
the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of ta  with angelina jolie providing the  t  and antonio banderas the  a    
structurally unsound and way too long   holy man  is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he isnt  
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening  
after taking a try at one of antoines clients and earning 10  deuce decides to prostitute himself to raise the money to replace the fish tank before the fierytempered antoine returns  
and to top it all off  the  twist  ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever  and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time  
the next element in the film is the part when things go awry  
keep that up  geoff  and youll qualify for the next batman venture  
his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes  
matt mahurin is virtual oneman crew in putting this film together  directorwriter cinematographereditor   who is a still photographer in his day job  
however  burtons attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy  
but serling never tackles the allimportant question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language  a language they had no opportunity to ever hear  
sorvino is o  k  although shes not very good at conveying terror  or anything emotion really  
to make things even more interesting  it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation  
and michael keaton  
the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story  
and this  as they say  is where the healing begins  
the carnival sideshow climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this nobudget production  
judging by the ridiculous premise  this was not exactly a wise move  
so  in 1  000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time  with only a few weeds growing over it  
it seems that neither the director  producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film  
even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor  his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality  
in one scene  sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask  
the opening sequence is by far the bestan amusing spoof of cliffhanger  with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon  
jericho cane  arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role  is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan  living in gabriel byrnes body  and stop him from impregnating christine york  robin tunney  because if he does  and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist  
in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage  one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past

we started the series off with harold ramis  who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as cowriting ghostbusters  
only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile  
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes  
frankly  its a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest  the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap  the big picture  and waiting for guffman  
  
  starship troopers   loosely based on the robert heinlein novel  is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects  
there isnt a single thing here we havent seen  and its not given to us in a way that remotely evokes our interest  
there are hardly any significant moments in this film  and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of  barb wire   
mr  schwarzeneggers attempts to be menacing are laughable  and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable  frankly  everything he does onscreen is laughable  
secondly  a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery  but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score  
the villains  the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman  take over  and our epectations are always left unfulfilled  when we wanted the penguin to bite off batmans nose he simply gets mad  and when we want catwoman to slither over batmans body she gets pushed off a building  
he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble  
  aside  if blandy sic must appear in the next one  try to keep the number of times she says  baby  to a minimum  
but its just too little of what moviegoers and especially fans of the game will expect  
  house on haunted hill  initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombielike mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible  
those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed  
why this is scary is never explained  
mel gibson  that hollywood zombie  decided he didnt like the ending and had another director reshoot it  
although the snuff industry hasnt really been examined in mainstream cinema  8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most  
actor bruce dern  who plays the throwaway role of the gatekeeper in this film  was once nominated for an oscar for best supporting actor for his role in coming home  
well  its main problem is that its simply too jumbled  
whoa  the suspense is almost too much  
lost my train of thought  
as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion you keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile  
if youre caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and youre standing in front of the movie theatre  you might as well go in and watch 28 days  
the characters are mostly lifeless  played to type  but not much more  
a little humor would have helped the script some  but a complete rewrite would have been better  
dont be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey  a time to kill  and renee zellweger  jerry maguire   
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing  this stuff is almost entirely softtossed  presenting an obvious problem  when grossout humor loses its shock value  its no longer funny  merely gross  
there have been merchantivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than  the mod squad   a selfconsciously  hip  cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many babyboomers  
in star wars  the rebels were the good guys  
somehow  chucky moaning about mid life crisis  and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky

although  at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc  and is surprised when he doesnt get that response  
ugh  
its not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity  but there it was nonetheless  
suckups  
the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium  
we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in faceoff and in the original mission impossible  which as convoluted a plot as that film had  it was still a superior film to this sequel

reminds me of the  transformers  cartoon  and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent  but that never happened  
the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another  but there is no consistency to the characterizations  
was it  deep   
soon enough  charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second  independent personality named hank  a deepvoiced  boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster

the room is packed with patchs supporters  
it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin  from the original  psycho   but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen

naturally  they win  or sort of halfwin  
most  unfortunately  will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production  
every opportunity to create dynamic tension is thwarted by plot holes and lackluster direction  
  these were exceeded by the unintentional ones   
theres a base of humor  
despite how horrid a film may be  the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up  
not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting  but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform  
some of the more ludicrous moments come when its alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist

in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge  
  theyre 17 larger than they used to be   he proclaims  
his 25year marriage to ellie  diane keaton  appears  on the surface  to be perfect  
it does have the occasional funny line and situation  leary  henry  lloyd  steve buscemi  and dave chappelle shine in their small roles  keener is a likable  refreshingly earthy lead  berkleys appearance is mercifully brief  she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a tenminute role   and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket  last year  the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six monthsdue to lack of viewer interest

hes not supposed to be tracking him any more  according to the bureau  theyve got their man  but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise

in fact  the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original  instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another  the filmmakers bombard us with usedup  tired jokes taken directly from the first one  
after 92 minutes  it ends  
the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future  complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves   but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively untechnical fellow would  think  it would look and behave like

because of his excellent record  childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador  ben kingsley   cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops

he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle  laurence treill   
and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster  
but with fight club  he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and selfreferencing film elements  such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing  telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good  flashback humor   
some of them  for example  come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist  for example  harrys spontaneous job offer  or the whole typewriter situation   
as a result  most songs get maybe a lyric or a half  but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives eyes  the wedding singer vols  
he comes across as absolute overkill  
the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality  
so here comes species ii  with a new creative team  director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman  respectively  that fails to improve the series one iota  like its predecessor  species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid

the duo  look  the part  and admittedly the avengers is  more than most  heavily dependent upon style  but theyre no fun to watch  and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the pictures caperesque plot  
some of the characters are not proper for their roles  
not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects  the story  about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of  bad guys  and  find himself  in the process is realized in such a sordid  incapable manner  it becomes indigestible after a while

annabel and matt try calming her down  but no one shares casss visions

it starts off telling chajas story of how shes a lost jewess trying to find her identity  then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment  and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that cant be forgotten

  ladybugs  is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees  the pathetic team who beats the champs  cross dressing  and the presence of rodney dangerfield  
the effects are awful  the script is contrived  and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously  i think

filmed in southern france  the scenery  sets and costumes are spectacular  but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy  restless mtvish cuts  
watching it now for a second time confirmed that its an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever  
like the original  taylors character is the star of the movie  
cristofer kind of does that  though without an ounce of insight  and with a helping of leering exploitation  
even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 13  1994  or ghostbusters ii  1988  while not exactly brilliantly well made  are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value

the actors  and their relationship together  present the onetwo punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely  
but the movie is not a complete fatality  
i wish they would have either a  made this movie much  much funnier  or b  turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment

once mccabe escapes  the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills  
while the original was reasonably intelligent  and had a fugitive to root for  the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive  mainly because we know so little about him until way into the films overlong running time

it all begins with an irrational murder  followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer  bad acting by a good actress  anne heche   an improbable plot  bad acting by the main bad actors  some more killing  concluding in a climactic scene  mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie

it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself

paul verhoeven  the dutch auteur who dragged his violent  sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film  has never been what id consider a thoughtful director  though some of his films  notably starship troopers  have been lauded as artistic achievements   but he is the kind of hollywood film maker whos managed to  no matter what the budget  make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils

i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film  although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film  
anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans

after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year  i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them  but then i realized this is just not so  
the philosophy becomes heavyhanded  the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep  and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audiences hankie  
another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves  
frankly  its a bore  a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesnt entertain beyond its first half hour  
martha eagerly  deviously wants a grandchild  and then helen will be expendable  as far as shes concerned  
the prison is a grim place  even as prisons go  its been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks  which provides no end of technogothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against  
i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful  most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning  
i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead  
one thing i will give the movie is that its a complete departure for tony danza  
there are so many scenes that just dont work  its difficult to begin  
and the fault does not rest with the actors

the point is not that they cant act  and  for the record  they really cant  but that their individual personas  which works as a gimmick over the span of a fourminute music video  are too thin to survive outside of the truncated  video bite mtv world  
but the true star  and the only saving grace  of the film is the music  
the winner  surprise  surprise  is eddie  who becomes a fan favorite  and eventually the actual coach

i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997  
these two seasoned veterans carry their scenes with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film  
however the kirbys havent given dr  grant their real agenda in  jurassic park iii

robertss deliberately slow pacing of laurie craigs script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems

and its not the traditional argument for films like these  where you may in fact want them all to be eaten  even  aliens  played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers  but this was more of a plusside for the film as a whole than the opposite   instead  as another cliche goes  you just dont give a damn  
then theres the tone of the movie  
every scene with caans character exemplifies this perfectly  the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him  getting into conversations about  the business  and how it works and were hardly given a clue as to what theyre talking about  
matt keeslar portrays one of magoos sidekicks  his nephew  waldo  
that is true

mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer  and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics  
theres a word for people like you  nicolas

 this film is strange  but not really funny or biting  
well  the same thing happens in  the devils advocate   and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream  perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan  since it failed and he is the devil   but the point is that the last 90 of the film didnt happen

if  on the other hand  he can appreciate the movie for its campiness  then hell probably like it much better  
the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point  
theres also a mystery brunette  melinda mcgraw  and an assassination subplot involving the u  n  secretary general  but like any of it matters

what makes movies like cant hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work  and to a lesser extent  shes all that and never been kissed  is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke and write their scripts accordingly

my problem is that we see all of these women in the films trailer  so why do i need to watch the movie  
most of the characters are surprisingly twodimensional  and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort  lyonne  seems to go greatly unappreciated  
i feel the production got a little too smug  the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie

howard pigeon  jeff goldblum  is a 40yearold mineral water salesman who is married for 13 years to a wife constantly nagging him  elizabeth  mimi rogers   
any moves to  glamorise his life  which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do  will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness

and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie

though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments  i wouldnt take kids to see it  
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does  they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time  and call it art  
this film is essentially an 80 minute stalkandslash film  following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6  intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and  supposedly  haunting images  many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot  
why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years  and even more so  why would they only give the shrink until the days end to do his part  
why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her  
throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed  it goes from months to weeks to hours   
its also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste  because it s evident that theyre all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie

nothing works in this film  as to be expected from joel schumacher  who has made only one watchable film in his entire career  that being  cousins    
lets just hope and pray that its just an urban legend

hardly anything makes sense  
she  however  sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husband  michael york   a crime actually committed by a onearmed  onelegged  oneeyed man  aaron pearl   
overall critique  
as such  the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned  and the film attempts  to no avail  to reach a profundity that it doesnt deserve  
this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an  r  rating due to violence  so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film  
there are plenty of recurring characters too

the first movie worked by never showing us the horror  
oh  yeah  theres corny oneliners   im gonna reach out and touch someone     
not coincidentally  the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movies remarkable trailer  a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself  the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year  
as eves hardworking husband  adam arkin is  predictably  squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do  until a subplot reveals itself midway through  only to never be mentioned again  
the movie makes many attempts at humor  only a few of them work  
until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice  
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary  their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filteredlight sleaze

and schneider  here to provide comic relief i assume  is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene

buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink  
all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat  
its not the whole oralsexprostitution thing  referring to grant  not me  that bugs me  its the fact that grant is annoying  
ugh  whatever the case  it was just about the time that douglas character suddenly removed murphys character from the mental home  and how come she went with him so nicely  
the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes  as does the rest of the film   why is the ships computer  which sounds strangely like hal from  uh   2001   able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine

the film is best described as a cross between an hourlong cop show and a music video  both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half  
incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand  russell crowe  dejectedly returning from work to his home  
you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people  having no choice but to work together to get somewhere  hating each other at first  but over time  learning to respect one another as individuals

branagh proves once again that hes a superb performer  nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly  
they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible  level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance  
in fact  it might even be the worst  major  release film to come out in years    
the ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghostlady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point  
the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender  
urban legend is a mad slasher flick  but one that is so sanitary  bloodless  and nudity free  that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful  though not overly talented  cast  it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special

it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film  and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about  especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously

if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for  then he achieves his goal  
hence the title  
as one might expect from the synopsis  director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences  including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say  goodbye  to one another  in addition  theres a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor  urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself

the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of  mercury rising   
some critics  glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone  realized that it was something special  mr  lovell gave it    12 and wrote that  this is batman as batman should be

i just hope they dont make a sequel  
proceed with extreme caution

however  aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance  this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device

morale was low  there being little hope for the future  
the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are cute  
quite bloody at times  the story  full of horrific images  seems designed to shock and repulse us

unlike most ed wood films  this one tries to be funny and fails  instead of the other way around  
the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped  so that by the end we dont even care who the killer is  
you know what to expect from this movie  lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator  croc cam  swimming toward someones dangling legs while  jaws  like music plays  one character  hector  whos obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest  another character who insists that the predator cant possibly exist  
a moment like that never arises  
but just what is it thats differnt for girls anyway

sherman has just invented a new  youth drink  that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time  
banks and hortas  intentional  attempts at humor are also lame  the fact that the best gags are lazy  injokey references to the other credits of costars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor

he goes on to add   we know more about her than she does   
and why they chose john cusack  a great  quirky actor in his own right  to play the most bland  uninteresting and unfetching character  with zero chemistry with either of his leads  is further more  beyond me  
the next car

the virus causes people to act like insects  they crawl about on all fours  hide from bright lights  huddle in damp corners

bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie  because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids  making it just another  dating in the 90s  movie  
theres no hope  
or if it does  not a very good one  
do you speak english  
he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed  
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time  
it works as a dry comedy  which it does not overplay  
director hark tsui  whose previous film was the van dammedennis rodman teamed  double team   films at such a frenetic pace that its hard to know whats going on  whos on whose side  and what the point of all this is  
catherine keener is completely wasted as cages wife  although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves  
in self defense  the woman grabs a letteropener and stabs the man in the elbow  
what happens  
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology  this is where the plot gets ridiculous  
this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard  
what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere  tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued  almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace  
the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable  
just when we think the martha character is going to be useful  she disappears  and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on  
the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls  
there was  however  potential for this film  
the cinematography has a comic book redblue emphasis  which is nice to look at  but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old  killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape  trick  
the trailer gives away much  too much of the story  
bleak makeup and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into  
and when the action goes sour  what is there left to enjoy  
had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect  
writer kate laniers script is fatuous and director vondie curtishall doesnt have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and  as a result of their incompetence  whisperyvoiced ms  carey seems to be embarrassed onscreen  
      leigh  is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate gameexperience in the form of existenz  
even worse is the treatment of secondary characters  
the same could be said about this movie  
the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw  with voices dubbed in later  
the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from  dune   
  as alessa so delicately puts it   we were bosom buddies  now were fuck buddies    
seeing her was one of the highlights of the film  
now  brandi is a psycho bitch  but its hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage  
salon kitty  his 1976 film  is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern  book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2  
she has only seconds to decide who will be saved  
it features an idiotic script  a hack director  and a onedimensional star who is past his prime    which 
he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation  
the movie is torture to sit through  
the thing is  they decided  to shroud myth and fantasy with a purely believable human tale of  suffering and coming in terms with ones problems  which ultimately  brought it above the ashes which it had initially put itself in  
there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise  
  she does  we discover later  have an imperfection  but deuce decides it isnt important   
she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever  
all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didnt make me feel any more fulfilled  
yes  the film is that weak  but its better than the other blockbuster right now  sleepy hollow   but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film  
it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street  whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just  doesnt  die

theyre taught how to pretend that theyre listening by nodding and saying  uhhuh   and how to compliment shoes  
keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable  and in a very small amount  makes up for the cheeziness of it all  
the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse  this being nothing like the pulseemitting monolith in  2001   that one was on the  moon    but when they try to study it  a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them  all except luke  who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station  which looks strangely like the rotating space station in  2001    
another thing is the destruction scenes    
in the middle of the forest  
as mentioned before  anyone looking for some disastermovie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed    
the marketing was brilliant  and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film  
its no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy  
rusty becomes a vegas high roller  providing most of the films best moments

there are a few good scenes  though  such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum  this is  however  the most forced scene in the film  for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn

the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly  a  because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs  and b  because mels schtick doesnt evolve from act onehes the terminator stranded in a plot without a scifi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone

deuce goes on numerous  dates   and each woman he goes out with has a  humorous  quirk about herself  
the film depended on its cast to work fluently together  like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion  
but seriously  the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s  cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters  
having two directors  colin south  john tatoulis  doesnt help either  the most glaring example of which is the final retributionfight scene  where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action  and more importantly it doesnt pull away to anything else

giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasnt for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie

surprisingly  julie brown  who i usually find just plain goofy  was the best thing in the film  
while im not entirely sure what he was smoking when he cowrote this script  willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big  fat  ugly joke

they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude  its so quick you cant even tell for sure whether youre seeing her andersons or not

its hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them  
even with its paperthin characters and ludicrous setups  hush manages to create a few thrills in a colorbynumbers fashion  
maybe he just wanted to piss me off  
my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy   okay  its police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber    and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster  
its not even just another case of cliches strung together  well  it is that too   its something thats painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws  
squandering an intriguing premise  the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess  widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike  and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success  raking in over 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast  ben kingsleys a splendid actor  but a marquee name he aint

if youve made celebrated films  dont do an ensemble piece  
this is one of the worst films of the year  and if it is any omen of things to come  this summer could be one of the worst ever  
ultimately  its an unfortunate effort  for  while it isnt unbearable to sit through  it isnt a howl  either  
one  these characters have very little to say thats engaging or interesting  
otherwise  skip it and see analyze this  810  again    now 
at least his direction makes up partly for it  
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry  
all in all  the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place  and i kept wishing i could fastforward to the next development

the young woman has mesmerizing hair  although it hangs too artfully  even by movie standards  to be believed  
after a series of missed opportunities  the comedic part of the movie is over  and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie  
the cinematography is sufficient  wild and erratic during action sequences  dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes  and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue  
while films like e  t used great actors  music and direction to pull of a masterful hearttugging scene  what dreams may come is haphazard  expecting the emotion to come out of the scene automatically

but  on the other hand  since when do really bad slapstick  a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grants head in joan cusacks lapa scene he paid 60 to have included in the movie  and obscene double entendres  robin williams  the obstetrician  tells grants pregnant girlfriend she has  a big pussy   referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat  but nonetheless  grant paid 60 to have the exchange included in the movie  pass for comedy  
and its all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flatout black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time  
to make matter worse this print was poorly subtitled into english from french  
and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie  
the mysterians see this as both good and bad

this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled bluecollar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times  
at this rate  usuallysplendid actor mr  fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man  his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettablyneglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days  
i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing  
the films humor also didnt tickle my funny bone either  
they open up a successful restaurant  where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it  even though hes a loafer  
sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory  gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds  the rise and fall of gallant heroes  and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life

the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying  
most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera  with painfully limited success  
in panelsized morsels  implausible plots and  rambo  esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork  but on thirty foot silver screens  its much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures

captain john smith is a blond hunk who  while  slightly  misguided  is good at heart

first the critic in me  
the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie  this is one of those occasions  
wayans approaches each goround with gusto  but by this point hes simply treading water for the rest of the films unfunny duration  
contains nudity and graphic violence   
the number of times that i checked my watch  six  is a clear indication that this film is not one of them  
the script isnt strong enough  though  to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin  house party   
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing  
its stupid in itself  and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is  
while the stories are similar  the new version adds too much to the once likable story  and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off  
of course the blame cant all be hoisted onto the actors  though with the exception of the little kid  they probably should have known better   instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder  who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er  then went on to make two awful genre films in a row  
but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story  
one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoons loaded weapon 1  that  in many ways  symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry  lack of originality and ideas

she wants to make things right and go straight  especially with the fact that she has a sixyear old son out there who doesnt even know shes alive  
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the managers office

naturally  this got me worried  
reynolds could have been good  but sloppy writing andor editing keep walter in the corner  and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together

the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chopchopped into the story  
the film opens on the wrong note  of course  with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen  using the overused passage  what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul   depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer  fucking around with his own sister in a field  i suppose if one has to lose their soul  one has to have a soul in the first place

some people will say all of thats irrelevant  the movie hinges on the battle scenes  
the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another

    the following review contains spoilers    
the director just throws the material at us  giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director  
frequently  it did the impossible  and got  worse   
in addition  the movie treats sexual fetishes  and sadomasochism in particular  as if its a perversion of everything we know to be pure  
there are moments  albeit brief ones  where this rises above the wasteland  
it goes without saying that  desperate measures  needs an operation of its very own  
too many  
snake eyes is a criminal act  an evil waste of time and talent  
it s not thoughtprovoking  though it would like to be  and it is definitely not scary  though it pretends to be

the punchedup punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the generals daughter has a brain in its head  even as the remaining 75 of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense

this is so much exactly what this little film is about that its campy  
and the language they talk is earth english  
such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations arent met  the results are far worse than if there was no hope

  virus   in comparison  is a servicable thriller  wellmade and produced  but since it doesnt include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence  it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on  
this is one example  there are actually some more in instinct alone  of filmmakers insulting the audiences intelligence  
actually  for the better part of  oh  20 minutes  it appears  money talks  has the momentum to cover entertaining ground  and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker

in short  they should have gotten paul anderson back  
the problem is that she needed to marry at alland that if she did not marry  she would still be just as unhappy  
at first its humorous to watch the teddies waddle around  but then it becomes goofy  
he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach  then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning  
its vaguely tarantinoish  but in a bad truth and consequences nm way  with phillippe  in one scene  leaping into a stupid rant about  faggots  migrating to los angeles  
  he gets major points in his black book for this  but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death   
in fact  the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earthshattering revelation that is yet to come

comic book translations are notorious tricky anyone up for a doublebill of the punisher and captain america   and the crow proves no exception  
there are two main types of villains in movies like this  the ones that are part of the story  and the ones that are devices  
its not clear how this benefits terl  except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it  
they dont care enough about anything to know whats worth fighting for  gladiators who live only for the battle  
this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene  but actually does little more than annoy

a big director  jan de bont of speed and twister fame  
i know in slasher movies there isnt supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself dont mind cardboard cutouts  but please dont let the cutouts be so damn bland  
i suppose this film could have been watchable if it werent for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing  
but nothing in those shots is as jawdroppingly unconvincing as blawp  a monkeylike space creature that becomes pennys pet  
i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the screams  
frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that ive never watched an episode  
for good measure   ghostbusters  had the comic talents of rick moranis   evolution  offers seann william scott  who was much funnier in  american pie  and  road trip  than he is here  
he responds   youre getting one   and its damn clever because hes sitting down at the time  
the script is horrendous  
a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end  
ho  ho  ho  shes so awfully clumsy  
the best word to describe this film is  asinine   
no kidding  this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going  
coming from such a talented writer  director  and cast  not to mention one of the most interesting film composers  danny elfman   a civil action  is an astoundingly emptyheaded drama  one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience  
the parts are so overplayed that with a little push  palmetto  could have been an overthetop parody of film noir a la  romeo is bleeding   
a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasnt what was trying to be achieved  
instead  its failings go much deeper  
there are no performances worthy of notice  no interesting character or story surprises  
odette is found dead  leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks  
  1999s  outside providence  was technically an earlier project   
after the first fifteen minutes  it quickly becomes apparent that it is not  
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault  flooding the vault  
for the first hour or so  murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting  
two hours later  theyre still waiting  
but to tell the truth  i was glad they didnt go on  
hmmmm  well  the main actor  justin chambers  is basically an uncharismatic version of chris odonnell but with less range  think about that    and mena suvari  is just plain off  
wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences  
in fact  nothing in  simply irresistible  goes anywhere save for gellar  and she doesnt go somewhere so much as you wish shed go somewhere  like to a better movie  
we see one side of a persons faces  
knives plunge into flesh  bloody fingers trail off into the darkness  and none of it is explained until the very end  when it was too late for me to care  
the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before  and just come out stale  
when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble  instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys  i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times  
its a tough genre to parody  
a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while  after that  something needs to be done with the big gorilla  
problem is  he doesnt have any skin  and even after three or four corpses  still doesnt get any skin  
director jon turteltaub  who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly abovepar cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that  contrary to what this movies promotion would have you believe  it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs  
in my review of  the spy who shagged me   i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics  every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series  it is followed by a third movie that is a bore  
im sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with  so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm  
during one important scene  a song played loudly in the background  
its remarkably bad timing  id say  to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind  
as an instructor of english myself  i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature  a teacher would stoop to reading a students bad poetry  of course  its valeries  about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poems inspiration  
  the short films are presented in order  btw   
i had high hopes for  gone  because it is director dominic senas second film

how did these two ever get together  
  low 0  4 to 4  
at first  when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role  i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber  
i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid  and if handled correctly it probably would  
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football

dr dolittle  20th century fox  running time  1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor  1996   murphy returns in this abysmal comedy  
i cant remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along  
maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real  
rather  the tense situations are left dangling at the end  giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness  
this time out  hes a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show  
anything can be made believable if executed correctly   the events of the film arent shown with any sense of urgency or importance  
maybe i sound crazy  but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film  and hope that they make it as good as the original  
for no apparent reason  other than to provide the main plot of the film  finn is instantly stricken for the estella  
shes of the  new people   theyre of the  old people  with  the memories   
nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie  
apart from casting sherilyn fenn  audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart  and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies  this film by ms  lynch hasnt got anything in common with the works of directors more talented father  
sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971  and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace  
the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles  and about as talented  
i was almost positive  until i saw the credits  that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind  who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl   because of the big name actors in dopy stunts  or stephen spielberg  after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholsonblowndownthestreet stunt  
in the middle of sex the dead teen has come back to life  
strength beats knowledge  
there you have a heartbeat  and emotional draw that doesnt let the audience catch its breath  
after all   blair witch  thoroughly creeped me out   sixth sense  was mildly spooky  and then  stir of echoes  had its moments  but wasnt anything id lose sleep over  
and just when you thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners  not rating anything lower than your standard  this movie sucks   along comes this cinematic atrocity and hes forced to take out his secret weapon and spray it with a stench so thick  even the bravest moviegoer would think twice about seeing this waste of time  
unfortunately  bats is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly  terribly wrong  
if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date  this film might do the trick  
the nonstop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed  without any interesting camera work  which is usually a trademark of carpenters  
and then there is the script by james herzfeld  whose only other film  tapeheads from a decade ago  was so awful that it is considered a cult classic  
maybe were supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesnt initiate his own sex romps  
while he is adept at dramatic roles  his forte is overthetop free spirits  
the main claim of the film  the special effects  are okay  
and then  the plot  along with the stupidity of the movie  thickens  
he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with  
i am all for a worthwhile family movie  but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful  
they spoke little  but fought a lot  
  has anyone counted the number of first penis references   
i found this to be a miserably poor explanation  if it was in fact the directors intent  then he needs to have some words with the writer  because it was not made clear at all  
your scripts are certainly respectable  your budgets are up there on the screen  and your actors dont dog it  
count the number of times where the animals mouth is turned away from the camera  or too far to notice  or illsynched  
another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare  
weve got a couple of hottotrot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them  
these early scenes were interesting  
however  if gal says  no  don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guys exporn star wife deedee  amanda redman   
obviously  
he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out  
for starters  the  group  is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis  
possibly its the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson  who penned the first two  or maybe its that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche  
instead  he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival  
unfortunately  none of his comic interludes are funny  
the film ends as this angel      
  you cant have any of this  
the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties  
even if they are both gorgeous  
unfortunately the film doesnt give too much of an explanation  assuming its audience is aware of kitanos earlier work  
one day  he discovers a grand piano  
instead  mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend  
no matter how you twist the  plot   youll find it incredibly stupid  even for a schwartzenegger movie    
very much like deep impact  a meteor is heading towards earth and they  didnt realize it until 18 days from impact  
will they get back together  
unfortunately  i can only post one of them  otherwise  id be getting some pretty angry emails from overprotective mothers  
the second half of the film  where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen  is a tedious home alone clone  with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy  scratchy cartoon  including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence  
hypothetically  i mean  
the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized  but instead are revealed through dialog  
shes unfathomably insecure  and succumbs so easily to all of shandlings lines and lies that it borders on tragic

well  a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk  
even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material  as this subpar submarine comedy proves  
0  one of the worst films of this or any year  
apparently  this is devastating  
as her husband  jim  clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness  
as it stands  the film manages more confusion than intensity  
do you think you know where this is headed  
in fact  darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet  
however  banderass role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special  
a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns  
this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book  like me  numbed by how much spawn misses the mark  
in retrospect  i can imagine how bad this film could have been  
the second room  jennifer beals  was better  but lacking in plot  
most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals  
itll keep you guessing alright but you wont remember the answers five minutes after the credits  
its compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way  leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny  
she thinks its an instance of an exsecretary of something or other  james cromwell  resigning because of a mistress  and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area  
meanwhile  in an unfinished subplot  bruce  batmans alterego  if you forgot  has been dating the lovely julie madison  the even lovlier elle macpherson  who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing  
as for freddie  if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year  prinzes next  summer catch  is liable to be a venereal disease  
wheres joblo coming from  
you apparently thought you needed a break from making  important films

the artist has a vision to create something new  
my  for some of the actors names and a joke or two that made me chuckle  i guess    okay  
these are among the many problems that plague  never been kissed   
if you havent yet figured it out  that is not saying much  
director bob clark is not a bad director  
at one point  he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a nonthreatening nicholson in  the shining   complete with them all hiding in the bathroom  but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away   
starring john leguizamo  mira sorvino  adrian brody  jennifer esposito  michael rispoli  bebe neuwirth  
and eventually  shandling falls in love with her    
we get the inevitable final confrontation  but it seems tacked on and rather anticlimactic  come on  were dealing with the master vampire here   
lucs interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team  
other laughable moments include a  luc going to a strip club to get internet access  what   and b  a group of rangers  who after having been given good advice  luc tells them that their weapons are useless  and shows them a specific gun which should work better   choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway  guess who wins the battle    
however  there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half  the most notable being the now infamous tent scene   and that just isnt enough to warrant even a minor recommendation  
in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout  carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film  
they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake  
also  there is the underrated  jacobs ladder   with tim robbins  a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism  
thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked  
and a romance angle  
as for the action scenes  they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films  but their advertisement for sadistic responses  is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence  which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen  
in fact  this isnt so much of a realistic  articulate  behindthescenes look at the rise of a rock n roll star  as it is an ambiguous  overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man  his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet  
wahlberg plays melvin smiley  an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman  see  grosse pointe blank  for the same character  much better developed

warriors on the other hand  are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat  and will do combat with every last bit of their energy  
anyway  it attacks this little town and its up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it  
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did  and decided to take the idiotically overdone route  
stealing from  alien    the abyss  and the disastrous  event horizon   this film has learned nothing from them  
we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them  
lane dixon  jared leto  is an enigmatic young hitchhiker  bob goodall  danny glover  is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination  
without properly establishing the crucial details of heysts character  all that is left of conrads main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement

there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of  scream queen  in the early 80s  
i still know what you did last summer  though cashing in on the success of the original  ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses  
instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces  were treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite  black elements   black helicopter  men in black action suits and body armor  black vehicles  you know the drill  
for anyone like me who got laughs out of webbs rapidfire speeches and straightfaced seriousness  think of the d  i

i went into the theater expecting to love the movie  
wooden just doesnt describe this guys performance  but itll have to do  
we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard  
onto the stove and  with an iknowwhatyoulike look on his face  says hes going to give her the  aunt jemima treatment   which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly  
being one of the worst movies of the year  we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies  and if they do they i give up on filmmakers  
this uninviting picture  full of pretentious minor characters  has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius  having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant  
but this does not save a misguided script  
he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times  
the hill house is not eerie

the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian  they use his gorgeous  adagio of spartacus and phrygia   ad nauseum   used in an attempt to give the film some emotion  but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere  
the film concerns mr  bean  atkinson  and his visit to america while escorting the painting of  whistlers mother  to an american buyer  played by burt reynolds  in the type of bit part that his success in  boogie nights  should hopefully do away with   
fichtners character is terribly underdeveloped  we dont know what hes doing there  where hes from  or who hes supposed to be  
every clue in the movie  every clue  is ambiguous  
there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film  
the following morning po sing is found dead  
there was no point to it at all  and it was hardly even in the movie  
the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff  and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie  
after an ingenuous opening showing pongos morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day  the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park  a little slapstick goes a long way  but hughes just keeps laying it on  
hayeks wannabe singer seems extremely forced and her husband  greg  meyer  stands in as shane oshaes surrogate best friend

the subject and the style seem to have been made for it  
with any film you see  whether you like it or not  you can at least understand what the appeal was to it  why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it

she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws  
costumed in skintight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone  she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring  not enticingly dangerous  
it was not funny  and i didnt hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film

overall rating review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities 
on the shoulders of bessons choppy and unexciting direction  the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery

he walks into the room and lauren holly swoons    yeah  
in many recent films  through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers  blacks are presented as fasttalking  conniving  scam artists or hiphop  guncrazy  sexcrazed youths

  payback   brian helgelands inauspicious directing debut  coincidentally  he previously penned the awardwinning screenplay for 1997s  l  a  confidential    is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one ideaa movie with nonstop violence  death  and villainsand runs with it  or should i say  barely manages to crawl away with it

so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for careys virginal target audience that its probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb  
one particular musical number   lesbian rock   was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my filmgoing life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan
