there are some great shots  some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences  and lots of other neat directional touches

outside of it  he is no less vicious or more easily controlled  
it runs about 15 minutes too long  
the fencing team and writing and producing school plays  and often pulling outrageous stunts  one that eventually earns him an expulsion  
although the film is extremely spiritual  its not about religion  
the main idea  that he can appear as anyone  in any form  in this case  a buisness man   harkens mainly back to terry gilliams the time bandits  
if only it felt totally complete  like  say   schindlers list   though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two   it might have been one of the best films of the year  and along with that  a full breath of fresh air  
the script needs a lot of polishing  
once the film hits its stride  it carries the viewer right along to the finish  with very few jars along the way  
simple  no plot  
it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil  and rooting for the good guys  in this case jeff

the first one is quite good  a decent introduction into the lives of these men  
on rewatching italian writerdirector dario argentos much lauded murder mystery tenebrae  i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with  
aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre  as alien was more of a suspensehorror film  
in those moments  and in others  iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience  
the film manages to cross all barriers  it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens  
some movies need a lot of time

jeff has a good job  a loving family  and most of all  a warm relationship with their mother beatrice  debbie reynolds   
the motion cameras film the action  and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once  
contrary to what has been reported over the past few months  this shaft is not a remake of the original film  but more of a sequelspinoff  
to make a film about gambling  a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters  
in fact  one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character  a rather overeager new york cabbie  frank van keeken from tvs  kids in the hall    who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story  
satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain peoples minds  and thats what  jude  is

director james l  brooks   terms of endearment    broadcast news   has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful  nominees for all the top golden globes  winners from the national board of review  inevitable oscars  and has a winner on his hands  
but  on the other hand  the film is very well directed  cleverly paced and the special effects  although definitely oldfashioned  are more than adequate for this kind of picture  
  fiction  has spawned so many imitations  ive lost count

now  instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora  he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right  
although zero effect is a bit awkward in places  it is a strong debut for kasdan  and shows great promise  
the mostlystraightforward chronology of jackie brown doesnt match up favorably to the nonlinear style of tarantinos previous efforts  an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives  
possibly that movies greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage  prior to the movie  during the movie  and after the movie    
in addition to the survivors from the original scream  the field of potential victims is wellpopulated  
it is rated r for strong sexuality  language  violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature

a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things  clay pigeons and even fargo  and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle  
my fellow americans is a movie that at first glance looks to have little substance  or a movie that weve all seen a million times   two lifetime rivals thrown together and then the fun begins  
like 10 things i hate about you  the stage is a high school  a private prep school where odin james  mekhi phifer  is the oncourt general  the basketball teams standout player  
i was not only enjoying the film  i was overwhelmed by genius of it  
in this film  the subject of drugs is never broached  only hinted at in an offhanded but slurring way  as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light  strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken  
the rest of the cast is also quite good  
mr  buscemi is off to a good career as a director  
note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers

  dangerous beauty   which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal  flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice  
although this is primarily mike and trents film  it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends  
but  the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show  
the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezkis sexy cinematography  notably  he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious  erotic charge thats steamier than the films  surprisingly muted  love scenes  
pumping out comicbook adaptations  terrible sequels to mediocre films  and remakes of foreign films to the nearest american movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls and bad sound systems  
hes the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness  
gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play  that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesnt mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants  
after their date  which seems to rather smoothly  things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincents highpriced heroin  dubbed a  monster  by lance  
trek fans may be more forgiving  but  for the rest of us  the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best  
the book  of course  was mario puzos the godfather  
after subsequent viewings  i feel that independence day really wasnt as great as it seemedthough i still give it a positive review

if he has any strengths whatsoever  it is an undeterring vision  and a good organizer  
admittedly  i wasnt a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film  and didnt expect much from this movie beforehand  but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments  as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line  
it turns out that he has a wandering eye  which angers his wife jessie  played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett  
a  j  
i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend  
lucinda is fascinated with glass  oscar is obsessed with theology

its funny   for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases  the adventures of elmo in grouchland  madeline  the nuttiest nutcracker  muppets from space  and baby geniuses  the only bad thing about this entire dvd    
americas involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place  
until he learns just who his secret benefactor is  
perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable lineup of acting talent  however  is gretchen mol who just didnt seem to have much presence on screen  
showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch  but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron  a great deal of symbolism is derived  
howard follows suit  though his efforts are in contrast hamhanded and desperate  
langs observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior  
samuel l  jackson is very good  but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction  although much less cynical   
certain scenes are so precisely executed  perfectly framing moments that are absolutely falldown funny  
just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen  we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success  
im sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more  but klass focuses on the two main parts  
its nice that as the characters develop  so does our comprehension of their world  
johnny rico  casper van dien  is ready to join the infantry  mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez  denise richards  has enlisted to be a pilot  
a standoff  
even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case  happenings began to link itself to the murder  
his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies  and sullen apathy  
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked  
scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker  
now that its out  i see no real reason for that delay  as its a simple yet highly entertaining film  
at the age of 13  jeanne  milla jovovich  watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers  
its roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do  
the reason  
im not entirely sure why  exactly  
arrow videos digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixedcoffin  
the movie is filled with dreamy  symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship  that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere  
there lies the main  and probably the only flaw of this great picture  lack of conflict  and consequently  lack of drama  
thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance  by far the best performance hes ever given and further proof that hes the best character actor in contemporary cinema  if you dont believe me  go back and watch his wonderful performance in  primary colors   a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadnt been in the same year  because hes easily able to slip into a character  and make him completely and utterly believable  
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself  regularly assailing the passions   
and  even though it would mean the end of privacy  people would eat it up  
even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion  one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend  ruby  marisa tomei    hes a freak  but he sure tells a good story   
more like the coens  raising arizona  than their hit  fargo    the big lebowski  demands an open mind and even more open eyes  
what can we do  
lately  however  i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  
the film is elegantly shaped  
enjoyable  scary  and even sad  titanic is a film cinema was invented for  filling the screen with incredible images  and assaulting the ears with awesome sound  
its an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside  
in the end   rounders  holds a winning hand  
stepping away from the stereotypes though  viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer  
there are many moments  such as this  in which director paul weitz uses a gameplan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary  to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief  
now teaming with codirector peter lord  park has created a similar creature in  chicken run   
im never thrilled with the idea of a followup to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations  
and its a big one  
however  we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think  
amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale  of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason  
so paul agrees and the race is on

i was almost stunned by the quality of  who framed roger rabbit    a fun  unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together  
he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch  because without eight taels of gold  a man is not a man  my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east  and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb   
instead  its a classic in its own right  
let me open this one with a confession  i love cop movies  
its hard to make a controversial movie and not preach  but kaye has found the right note for his material  
these were superfluous and a waste of money  
but naturally  all this sappiness  melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin time at the movies  
as carlos  hernandez is a revelation  
this is also a tale of revenge  and a funny one at that  
but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends  
he arrives at the same time as annie oakley  angela douglas  who is seeking revenge for her father  the sheriffs murder  
at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate  
the performances in the curve are very good  
this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off  
brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides  
its a wonderful performance in a role customtailored for him  mr  toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr  downey jr  was arrested on drug charges  and its hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character  in a monologue to his mirrored reflection  blakes selfchiding to  get his shit together  is disquieting in its resonance  
dizzy flores  dina meyer  has enlisted as a trooper  and its possible shes joining merely to follow rico  whom shes always had eyes for  
it is a beautiful film of great importance  completing the tragic saga of the corleone family  
their story  of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar whocares attitude crossed with camp  is engaging  without the personal background  
the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense  keeping the viewer guessing until the very end  and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion  
the film is told nearly first person from williams point of view  as he is in every scene  
the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding

for the most part  however  the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types

part of it is his fault  hes too optimistic  and too gullible

after becoming pregnant  for the fifth time  she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child  
these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with  probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb  
this season could probably be the most ambitious  season this decade with hollywood churning out films like deep impact   godzilla  the xfiles  armageddon  the truman show  all of which has but  one main aim  to rock the box office  
shot in panavisions famed super 70mm format  the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic  
event horizon is highly recommended   but at your own risk  
on one hand  it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character  unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs  nugent  fiona shaw   
and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending  that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better  
the motto was well chosen  
written by hershman  greenfingers contains plenty of laughs  
the stunts are spectacular  and the fact that you can spot van dammes standin makes his work no less impressive  
i found the writing wellwritten as well as the acting was great  
maybe its because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique  
never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film  and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character

despite these small problems   last night  is one of the best movies of the year  
as a director friedkin has been well known for other films  but his standout film is  the exorcist  nominated for several academy awards it one a few  but was somehow doubted best picture  best actress  ellen burstyn  and best supporting actress  linda blair  who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl  alone  possessed and unable to stop what is going on

with the opening sequence  and some others  it is not original and is  
a wonderful life  
a lot of the movie is like that

review by david wilcock  1998

fred  george  doug and howie are reaching middleage  
bruce willis is terrific  and im glad to see him bigger than life again  recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing   
the crew is a prime example of how simple and drywitted a comedy can get these days

ultimately  what is so good about  final destination  is that  within the confines of the slasher genre  writerdirector wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner  and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frightentwo things that are rarely found in todays horror films  
one thing that i would definitely recommend is  as jet li pointed out himself on his website  that you leave the kids at home for this one  
  rated  pg  
however the emperors evil son commodus  joaquin phoenix  murders his father before the announcement can be made  and maximus  as well as his family  is sentenced to be executed

perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the heroor heroine  as the case may be  
it could have lead up to something more  or at least an amusing conclusion

but there are also many  many delights for adults  including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matildas classmates recite in singsong fashion  there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matildas father

clooney  too  transforms into a blandly heroic protestormarching with the rebels  i waited for him to shout   let my people go   
this scene  while comical  is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation  then of relief and discovery

these set pieces are functional in the way the script is  they work well enough  but theyre unsurprising and conventional  
the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble hes going through for her

her claim to fame is that  as a juror on the whitewater trial  she wore it in court as well

when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead  you know that hes over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become  
in the middle of the city  and against no real opposition   zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops  
the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon  a testament to the acting jobs of both  
as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens  i have some idea of how ellie aroway  jodie foster  feels  
moments  and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film  scream still has the first   
watching  simon birch   however  creates a different feeling altogether  the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character  surely something irving would not have intended  
there is quite a bit of humor in this film  and without it  it couldve fallen into a drab  cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause  
i know this story  
earlier this year  the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics  
and its amazing the compassion that we have  it seems so real to us  and not merely because its happened before  splashed all over the front pages  but  because of the all around  nice  persona of these people  we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters  
the prison authorities demanded good hygiene  provided medical care when needed  and  hard manual labor  consisted of picking grass  
right away we know that that is exactly what hell have to do  
such a movie comes around only once in a lifetime  where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling  and this  friends  is it  
the main highlight would be keatons performance  
the drawing is televised and the woman  gloria stuart  whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely  the ships story is told  
yet it is his offthewall masterpiece brazil  to which this film bears the most visual resemblance  
the soundtrack  synthheavy  reminded me of bad 80s horror movies  as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes  
thankfully  legend rose above its soggy premise to become not only a hip  scary and stylish entertainment  but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year  
go see it  
and yes  i did see mimic  which is something ill touch on in a later review  
it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched  
anyone who knows of  or has had any association with moviemaking should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for its entire duration  
although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now  it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works  even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand  
despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phonepitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script  
the previews were so annoying that i predicted this was going to be the worst film of the year  or at least in the running

so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a raillaying machine  
first  a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means  
the film has a hypnotic feel  free of any restraints of form  and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about  
the plot  set  a long time ago  in a galaxy far away   begins in a time of civil war  
a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately  so he packs some clothes and leaves  never sure why hes leaving or what hes fleeing  
rather  it is lancelot  and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart  than the external downfall of a kingdom  
with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs  it makes for a fun film  
the romantic angle works well  though  surprisingly  the interactions between joe black and william parrish are more interesting than those with his daughter  
family problems occur  
peter fondas performance borrows from his father henry fondas in on golden pond there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father  peter fonda is quiet  emotional  and weary in this exceptional role  
the special effects are outstanding  though  warning   
its very familar  your typical horror film  
anyway  this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of  for about twenty seconds  and if you arent looking for it you wont even be able to tell  
i also hated the  kid  character who just got on my nerves and didnt really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved  i wont ruin it here but cmon guys    you 
unable to protect his boy in any other way  guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp  
throughout the entire movie  no explanation is given as to why this is happening  
where the money is does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist  
active since the 1960s  morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts  
barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with  
as with most coen brothers films  this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes  each of which works out in the oddest way possible

this is clearly a racist society  evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others  and it will soon affect him and  his family  
if this predicament wasnt bad enough  hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos  
hopefully  though  their silly moral outrage wont spoil the joke for the rest of us  
lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance  
the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time  
that moral  by the way  is  our destiny chooses us   and its something of a surprise when  rounders  supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect  mike does learn from his mistake  but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be  
chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself  
and that gets her killed  
in my opinion this kind of movie sex is cutting edge for 1999  as rare and thoughtprovoking in american cinema as showing a spanking  
however  carmen isnt as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot  
it was weirs first stroke of genius to create seahaven  a suburban paradiseprison that would make spielberg cower in shame

libby hears a strange noise  wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood  
tim burtons retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys  
its not even part of the movies real agenda  
the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williamss score for the first film

this film brims with imagination  containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell

revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown  and thats the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film  
the legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi  
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible  
the myriad of inside jokes and gags  the characters are named after famous horror directors  one character who plays a jerk is named carter  like xfiles creator chris carter  and a song by john denver  who died in a plane crash  plays whenever death is near  show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie  
iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2  at times  fighting styles  especially that of monkey himself  do devolve into the ridiculous twinkletoed floating of films like crouching tiger  hidden dragon  director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth  
the best line of the movie is spoken when a key player dispenses advice to one of the detectives unsure of what to do  
does being human necessarily imply humane behavior  
with sharp  intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity  rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols  
also making a great addition to the series is mini me  who is played by verne troyer  
the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan  but that between crowe and david caruso  
look back on past disney animated features and youll see the trend  
it isnt exactly perfect  but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them

cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown  but theyre not out to harm him  reallythey just want to be heard  even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler

ooh that one really gets me going  these protectors using all that at their service  taking advantage of others for their own gain  
after having heard so many critics describe  return to me  as an oldfashioned hollywood romance  i kept asking myself going into this movie  what exactly is an oldfashioned hollywood romance  
another firm recommendation by joe schmoe

some have labeled  blood simple as a modernday noir  but  while i am not an expert on either genre  it seems more like a horror movie than anything else  
call it touched by a demon

benjamin wants to turn the  show into a big hit nationwide  possibly destroying the  essence of  waynes world  in the process  
the film ends a little too deliberately  too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film  but it barely detracts from the overall experience  
the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors  
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom  
graham  boogie nights  1997  has a small but good role as lorraine  a girl mike finally falls in love with  
still  the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it

  honestly  i expected a bad irish accent  but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea  so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game   
his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1  000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hairraising than anything spielberg put on screen  
prior to this film being theatrically released  it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo  i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times  
set in the 1940s  the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells  tobey maguire  ride with the devil   
even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images  
it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and trumans well being  
like the baron  ruafro continuously has his skin looked after  it is stretched and stapled by servants  
and the whole time  their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested  
but they were brief scenes and really shouldnt take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing  
and for fans of revelationheavy endings  this films got a few shocks in store that i wont even dream of revealing

  then again  he was the only characters face we could completely see   
i say  surprisingly  because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong  
the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and  safe  widereleases coming out lately  still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry  
spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any threehour movie about the past should be framed by a selfcontained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present  
well  as this movie shows us  they make good companions but pale in comparison to the joy and fulfillment romantic relationships can bring  
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll  
most memorable of all  though  are tom skerritt and james woods  who play rival scientist dr  david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz  respectively  both  especially skerritt  embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances

the plotline of  the faculty   involving aliens taking over other peoples bodies  has been done quite a lot before  from  invasion of the body snatchers   to  the puppet masters   to  invaders from mars   so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh  and by setting the goingson at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens  they were mostly successful

robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible  godgiven gifts  but are able to act like ordinary people  
but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble  
if you have something in mind  please tell me  
she has been so upset since the incident

forget everything you know about corey haim  
her selfloathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success  marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired  
days after my second viewing of  the deep end   i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains  trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water  
personally  if i was spielberg  i wouldnt go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindlers list and the indiana jones movies  
however  mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity  and he does a good job  
demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice  
the film tries to pull your heartstrings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other  like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friends butt  
dies and goes to hell where he meets satan  
this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day  
while set several decades ago  this story remains completely relevant in todays society  where abused wives return to their husbands  and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other

in his mind  his daughter is dead  
i even liked the second jurassic park film  
her work is of awardcalibre  and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged  kirsten dunst  tina majorino  anna paquin  natalie portman  christina ricci  elijah wood   malones performance stands up well  
he is metatron  alan rickman   the voice of god  and he needs her help  she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey churchthe fate of the universe depends on it  
the message about hatred couldnt be spelled out any more clearly than it is here  but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation  
he walks in  unafraid of what he finds  and discovers a thief  george dyer  daniel craig   
shes quirky  shes elderly  shes caring

produced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg  
its not bad  i gave it     
with his gang in tow  roy attempts to rob the train  when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court  who also happens to be chon wangs uncle

if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance  this is the group that should sweep it  
granted  some conflict needed to be introduced on the island  but this tackedon development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes  
one of the problems in adapting fullblown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader  rather than being subjected to the realism of the screen  
other songs youll find yourself humming include when i was on top of you  a love ballad   the trappers song  the villains leit motif   and hang the bastard  the rousing finale   
the way some of the jokes are done are new  even though some of the jokes are old  
as it stands  the plot suffers many holes  im not taking about implausibilities   and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed  
most of the country is divided into tiny segments  some are controlled by guerrillas with guns  some are controlled by army soldiers with guns  and all the spaces inbetween are controlled by thieves  bandits  and terrorists  
i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film  
richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary  yet nice guy  who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale  
fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago  although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre  
the group quickly sizes up the situation and each other  
  dangerous beauty  contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic  but not so much that it seems exploitative

after a few hours  it turns from interesting to chinese water torture  
the stooges get hit by boards and dropped from roofs and  of course  suffer multiple crotch injuries  
carlitos way plays like a tragic novel  deliberate  confident and powerful  
robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor  
clarence is an angel without his wings  and each time the bell rings  the wings pass him by  
these charlies angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture  
with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately  what with that whole clinton thing going on  you know  100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern  oh  please  government  waste my taxes just a bit more  would you    
it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey  
the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film  not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury  not just against other races but within their own circles   
thanks to camerons direction  then  the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes  
van damme and rodman have nice chemistry  the stunts are eyepopping  and stuff gets blowed up real good  what more do you want

and with most fans of this movie  this is proved to be a rather easy task  although at times the graphic images  violence  and language may seem a bit overpowering  
and its here that the film seems to go a bit wrong  
wills reaction to this situation  and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean  is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters opinions  rather than setting up an obvious  right  and  wrong  side and beating them over the head with it  
during the middle ages  when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged  the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power  
firsttime feature director james wong made the most of that premise  
the storytelling is rich and complete  and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious  and at times  even hokey   its easily one of the best 1997 films  and one of the best scifi films ive ever seen  
name it  
the metropolis that has sprung from fords vision is a wondrous sight to behold  
damon and norton bring so much to their roles that theyd be worth catching even if  rounders  ultimately folded  but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning  
its just not right  and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes  
lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii  but he was more entertaining in aliens  
shot in the back and paralyzed for life  
the story is pretty basic tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla whos lost her young adopts him into her group  
in a perfect world   a civil action  would be a breath of fresh air  
this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park  
much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey   hate put me in prison  
if ever a film followed its original so well  it would be scream 2  and it makes this a definite mustsee for all those unbridled scream fans out there

this sets the tone for the rest of the movie  
its meaningless  
usually  it also looks like it rests among the clouds  
with a plot as unbelievable as this film  you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast  
the plot is interesting and robust  the latest lottery winner is ned devine  jimmy keogh   of tullymore  ireland

his nofrills visual style hasnt changed much over the years  though  dogmas widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations   nor has his writinghis characters still sit around delivering one caustic  hilarious speech after another  
by the time that one was over we havent had nearly our share of shag jokes  crude puns and powers antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites  
it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neonazi skinhead  a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone whos not what they are  and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off

but then  when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori  the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus
