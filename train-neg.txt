costar eddie griffin  really the star of the show  is quite a different story

sean penn stars uturn  as bobby  a drifter whos had some troubles a while back  
the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blanketyblank is going on

all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 arent as eyecatching now  
unfortunately  no one saves the movie  
she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated  injecting martha  poorly written though she may be  with a little empathy to level out the psychoplaying field

they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection  and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantilyclad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up  
hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible  
synopsis  a man whose lover  paris  was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system

theyre pleasant enough to watch  and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists arent  
as i said  the characters here are only present as a formality  they do little more than state the obvious  of  course  joe is too big for that cage

 they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animalrights group  but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlies angelsstyle outfits  
there is a moment or two of genuine horror  but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the scifi direction to make any use of it  
her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script  and there is no sense of realism about the character  
the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence  and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo  
did somebody say chairman of the board  
his robin needs nothing more than a good spanking  
its just a pretend film noir  making it a big waste of time  
funny  
accompanying these two girls are karlas overbearing boyfriend  tyrell  mehki phifer  and a potential beau for julie  
unfortunately  instead of updating the script  ironing out some of the faults  and speeding up the pace a little  a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder  leaving behind the nearly unwatchable wreckage of a wouldbe 90s thriller  
to turn beattys vehicle as a football player into rocks vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor

take away the likes of waiting to exhale  set it off  soul food  and eves bayou  and all thats left is a chance to be someones girlfriend  a local whore  or a murder victim  
the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes  
the movie will probably please only smiths diehard  undiscerning fans  everyone else will be critical of this mindbogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past  
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
even the reasonably clever climactic breakin falls victim to this syndrome  including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts  i kid you not  four minutes  
besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system  i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn

but if dubya dubya iii tells you to go out and spend money to stimulate the economy  then youd better do it  because gassing up the minivan twice a week just isnt going to cut it

it would have been easy  but of course  it wouldnt have worked  
it must have original action sequences that are designed to thrill  
but hes afflicted with loseritis

the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaines property with the hint that the violence may escalate

the films most effective scene is a tender  quiet exchange between clooney and alfred  michael gough   bruce waynes butler and surrogate father  
the only reason it doesnt drop below a  c  grade is because of the fine supporting performances  
a little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal  
every time i watch great movies like goodfellas  1990  or raiders of the lost ark  1981   a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent  skill and entertainment that is on display  
then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress  but for what reason  
other instances  though  i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script  
a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai  who handily kicks and punches his opponents down  
but thats not the worst part of it  its that its the one person you didnt think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring  the one you didnt think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it  
bottom line  ashley judd tries hard but cant save this predictable bore

the fact of the matter is that griffin  whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network  is an extremely talented comedian  standup and otherwise  
its also basically about violence and cheap titilation  and features a central relationship between a middleaged man and a twelveyearold girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension  
the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it cant love  it starts out by showing how under chajas loving care hes taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away  beginning by saying quack  quack and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder

lastly  theres the dog  who is used here in a similar context to puffy from theres something about mary  
im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel  at least in my world where the sky is blue  
this film needed that whole theatreshaking  they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored  
hes befriended by sarah  mia kirshner   presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film  
the movie sets up its  microscopic  plot with beatadeadhorseintoglue obviousness  
so  is it that bad  
i know he is  but he didnt do it in celebrity  
the actors are all miscast  especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife  who cannot act  and ving rhames as a computer hacker     who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie

then theres the ridiculousness of the many cops who actually shoot at fleeing cars

the reasoning is  of course  that if a comet is going to strike  they might as well be out in some scenic rural location  
to make even worse  some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure  especially art expert turned into arms dealer  played by bronson pinchot

  i  the jury  is one of several cinematic renditions of spillanes books  including a 1953 version which was made in 3d   but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way  it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywoods production code

comments  this movie was boring  
all in all  this movie is not funny  unless youre one to chuckle at train wrecks   provides zero drama  unless you consider loud phone conversations moving   generates absolutely no emotion  although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine  and ends on a perfectly pretentious note   oh no  please dont get any flour on my donna karan dress

  the sculptress  isnt even bad enough to be fun  
none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre  or the creatively stifled imagination of halloweens michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife  
and the jokes dont rise above that level  
chucky  again voiced by brad dourif   of course  is the star of the  childs play  series  a my buddytype doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer  
if there is one major objection i had to  metro   it was the length  an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes  
there are many nice special effects  mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zerogravity

the rest of the actors become caricatures in this bythenumbers thriller  
cage tries hard to pull it off  but the script doesnt give him enough to work with  
i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night  and let me tell you  it is the only way to watch this film  
not only is he a huge success as a businessman  hes also something of a celebrity  his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials  
what  
i  however  would rather cut to the chase  
as stated above  the first hour is superb and even the end is above average  
are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly  that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it  
its certainly not a bad film for kids  i doubt joe will give them nightmares  
based on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie  i cant imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to mehe gets jennifer lovehewitt  and my generation got heather langenkamp  
part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3d  and from what i can tell from the video  it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects  
this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers  but home fries brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel  
this is the movie that could singlehandedly bring  mystery science theater 3000  out of cancellation  
the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin  
scaramangas lackey is a dwarf called niknak  who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series  serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures  
welles goes about his assignment rather matteroffactly  and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly  almost as if you dont need any specialized skills or training to do this  
gloria  who keeps saying how she hates kids  takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys  
the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background  such as saharas perfume ads   depression  its not just a state of mind   
yawn  
but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend  jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinksaddled crosscountry voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love  
in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety  i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story  
i cant go back in time and reverse my mistake  but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there  
they need fresh air to get some perspective  maybe to start over  
im not exactly sure where all this money went  but it certainly did not register onscreen  
when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death  he becomes a ronin  much like a gunfighter in the american west  
then the meat of the plot presents itself  
and that wasnt the only thing getting on my nerves  
philip is not a lovable absent minded professory  just a really dumb man being played by robin williams  
the movie wants us to think   gee how clever and ironic  a guy who can kill without any moral implications  and yet he cant stand for anyone not to like him   
there are lines in the script that are just begging to be mst3ked  and im sure once mike and the bots get the cash  theyll stick it on their sked  
robbins varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved  
one of the problems  as i said  is that the movie doesnt make any sense  
unfortunately  manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies  independence day  deep impact  armageddon  that its becoming boring  
disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film  and it started out a wreck before shooting even began  
when you consider that this film is a partcomedy  thats not a very good sign  
i hope you get a good laugh out of this review  but i am not laughing  
dern is always great  and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie  
we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly  
check out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy  seven  
but tell me this  what the heck did that pig do  
the only other recent challenger to their throne was last falls promising  if flawed  20th century fox production  anastasia   but disneys  hercules   with its lively cast and colorful palate  had her beat handsdown when it came time to crown 1997s best piece of animation  
there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied sendups here  so its possible that directorwriter pat proft  by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two  guarantees something is sure to stick  
  3  dont let the special effects technicians walk away with the script  
there are several  warning signs  prior to the eruption itself  but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we dont feel as if they are leading up to anything  
it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain  
then  everything ends happily  
i dont care if its bob freaking dole in the white house  get him out of there  
as the megalomaniac boss  his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a bmovie  scrambled  and left in the shelf to rot  
martins bilko is a pale imitation  
by the end  will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph  
oh boy  and i havent even gotten around to the greatest piece of overacting that ive seen in years  
the first film  despite some raunchy moments  had an innocent charm to it  
after surviving these abysmal trailers  the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented  watchers reborn  
that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows  
she is a definite beauty  though  and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience  
hes cool for sure but hes made to be as empty as the movie  
a far cry from his days as linc in  the mod squad   i cant help but think he was acting from wests direction  
thats too bad  because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative  
tea leoni plays a  rather crap  news reporter  jenny lerner  who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way  and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew  spurgeon tanner  who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth  
another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass  more movies are copying  the blair witch project  s web strategy  
the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship  
it wants to be  predator  meets  braveheart  meets  the magnificent seven  meets  dances with wolves   
there are good scripts out there that highprofile actors can make  see the truman show  for instance    
blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light  and now works at the family store in town  
jb  scott bakula  the guy from quantum leap  plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell  
in an adequately equipped theater its as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate  
all thats needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich  s  
anyway  most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted  except for emily watson  who does another great job  and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack  who always delivers through thick and thin  
it stars a rising young starlet  helms a good cast  and is directed by one of the better actorturneddirectors in hollywood  
with  what is love   
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent  and his character is entirely too straightlaced for a movie like this  
of course  film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultraexpensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society  
so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasnt really meant to be much better than this  
i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their  likes  dislikes  skills  and thrills   but on the whole  its pretty bad  
is this hollywood    california   
is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors  
a statement about women  
well  only happen in the movies  
id say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen  so its almost forgivable when you realize theyre talking to nothing and interacting with nothing  
and an avaricious east coast railroad baron  thaddeus rains  harris yulin   is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value  aided by allan pinkerton  timothy dalton  and his infamous detectives who  back then  were just thugs who provided security  
i would  not  suggest paying money to see this  
simmons goes to hell and back  after making a deal with satan himself  if he agrees to command the devils army to overtake the world  hell be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda  underused theresa randle  and little girl cyan  sydni beaudoin   
and guess what  
the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey  
it looks nicer  and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework  
and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father  but mostly she exists just for sexual attention  
the film seems desperate to make a point  or a number of points  but i couldn  t figure out what they were  
tuckers audience  and he does have one  will probably like  money talks   
its one of those movies thats so bad its absolutely hilarious  due in no small part to its big star  supermodel cindy crawford  
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction  this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men   enchanting like the wizard of oz  of which this film makes several allusions to  and heartwarming like stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie  but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation  
and he has to be a clever rebel to do it  in scenes that stretch all levels of believability  
great detail is given about supermans proposed role in the original script before reeve  wisely  dropped out  
well  let me share my moment of sheer panic  and then the cold enervation of the big letdown when a semirobed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin   what do you think of my butterfly    
his accent keeps changing  i assume he was shooting for karloff  but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon  sean connery  and cartman from  south park   
a film that drags more than a dropped anchor  
the screenplay  written by arthur rankin  peter bakalian  jacqeline feather  and david seidler  which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein  has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory  as every time the obnoxious king would shout   etc  etc  etc   i would cringe  
if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover hisher sexuality  then thats one thing  but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie  i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well  
nothing  zip  nada  
then again  considering the quality of the writing  even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine  
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water  
in fact  the story is empty within itself  
aiding and abetting is the teams shady mentor  played in an excellentbutso what performance by morgan freeman  
by the time the last act rolls around  there is no sense of a payoff building  
  the whole nine yards  is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects  
but this doesnt either  since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintoshs kim foyle  and as either sex  hes just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like  
ryans preoccupation with his new honeybunny drives her elitist father  bruce davison  crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team  
nicholson does what he can with the role  and when he can find his bearings  can be extremely good  the scene in the church  for instance   but most of the time  he seems a bit stiff  as if hes not sure what he should be doing next  
keep this in mind  if youre in the mood for a good action film  rent the fugitive  
i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film  
upright  excop principal  played by the forgotten ghostbuster  ernie hudson  
whats needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works  there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country  and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow  
thats when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brothers death and to exact some of his own style of revenge  
this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12year old girls will find convincing  
in fact  all four parts are surplus to requirements  
had wood continued in this vein  glen or glenda  
at least for those first 40 minutes its an  interesting  ripoff of alien  
in loser  amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness  her one show of wit involves naming pauls dorm  hunts hall  after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall   
one of a kind  
as almost an afterthought  about halfway through  the film carelessly gives him a character trait  an addiction   and then drops it in the next scene  
while watching loser  it occurred to me that amy heckerlings true genius as a filmmaker is casting  
sadly  thats one of the films most enjoyable sequences  and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional  
for gods sake  no  these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling  
mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl  the cheerleaders of the wcw  
kara uses it to create a buglike thing which immediately crashes through the layer of  whatever  that protects the city  
however  because the actors are so irritating  the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying what the f  ck is that   
kneeslap   
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors  or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadnt started tinkering with the directors  walter hill  final cut  causing him to want his name removed  
it just means you grew up since seventh grade  
if youre in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey  dont  
the exs storyline  as i said  incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature  however  the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that  after a while  the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie

serafine disappears  but a smitten andy seeks her out  
one needs only to see his film  fist of legend  to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat  
this is a dreadful motion picture  a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughstojokes ratio  
this  like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review  is a horrid insult to our intelligence  
   the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and didnt take sides  
     because im a scientist  
douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr  moreau  who incidently  owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize  
it should have stayed there  
oh cringe  
your second clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see  charlize theron  one of the movies dubious stars  makes an appearance on the daily show in which  when asked if her new movies any good  she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh    
it does not succeed as a parody  
  the rugrats movie  is doa from the start  
theres a few good  imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese  a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud  
overall  then  youd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided  perhaps a plague  
along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau  tim guinee   a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl  
michael okeefe plays said caddy  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point  involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called  appropriately   whitey    but the script doesnt go anywhere with it  instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
attempts at characterization fall apart  
the fact that her character is bisexual is just icing on the cake  
i know im not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma    
the doctor responsible for all this  dr  caldicott  bruce greenwood   must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave  or  perhaps  this is the only realistic element in the film   
it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out  and that is because they reached for the lowestcommondenominator in filmmaking  favoring nonstop deaths and gore for suspense  and trading in fleshed out  likable characters for onedimensional nitwits  
to be mysteriously saved by a giant  gheorghe muresan   
never mind that it should never have been made at all  
it works as a buddy movie  which it does not overplay  
why   
the idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls  a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers  is a promising one  
annoying  
three guys in front of us smuggled beer into the the theater  
unlike its slippery cousin  anaconda    lake placid  wants to present its formulaic plot tongueincheek  which is selfdefeating  
boring  arty  pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as    
why they cast this unknown  fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me  
sharpeyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film

as a speed clone  it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps  god forbid  even some decent writing  
and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence  
writer maybury barely outlines franciss character  and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma  
this is 2000  you know  not 1985

there are so many scenes of talking heads  discussing what we already know is going to happen  that it drags the film to a dead stop

what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in  scream   ottman takes seriously  
the film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism  as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground

based on  just another sucker   a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase   palmetto  shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance  
one would think that david duchovny  star of the cult favorite  xfiles  would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles  
  the pacing in the secondhalf is especially abominable  
besides paulie  the only character worth noting  other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands  is the speechimpaired marie  played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer  5yearold hallie kate eisenberg  
however  gratuitous is joels middle name  
the new one keeps the basic plot  but appears to have added a lot else  like more absentmindedness on the part of the proffessor  some more villains  and several  showstopping  moments  like a big rumba with the flubber  and some more elaborate setups  none which really make it any better  but instead make it worse

she is able to control it now as long as she doesnt drive a car  ride elevators  follow in dancing  and is the woman on top when making love  
i realized that these constructs on screen arent actually characters  but devices present only to serve the story  
films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this  and now ice from the sun can be added to this list  
in the films best scene  he introduces steve to every single clique  nailing each ones fetishes and hangups  and its the best scene in the movie because its witty  satirical  and interesting  something the rest of this film isnt

now on to my review  
wild wild west 
calitri expects memphis to fulfill kips bargain  if he doesnt come through  kip dies  
old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film  
the premise is ridulous  but that is not why i didnt like this film  
in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin  jon stewart  and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian  cole and dylan sprouse  while kevin is on an overseas trip  
the weather is constantly overcast or rainy  
but if you ask me  the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american  
unfortunately  banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chases career look like oscar material  
things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to  
i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body  
  
and whats worse  it sends out a bad message to teens  
sadly  the mostlymisfired toilet humor  overly comical musical score  by bruce broughton   and sugar coated sentiments  all the key ingredients of a  family comedy   just arent the right tone for this film  
save her from those damn devil worshippers  
much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow  
since i didnt understand anything about these characters motivations  did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them onebyone  and he does  knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes   
  the cast also includes christopher lambert  who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films   
for 8mm  he delivers a very wooden one  and only shines when hes interacting with joaquin phoenix  who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case   
im not sure what the budget for species 2 was  but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors  as opposed to being diverted into the special effects   
the star power here is quite strong  but the viewer cant help but feel the actors are wasted in this production  
brian depalmas career has been bafflingly erratic  
along the way  of course  they get into a whole heap of trouble  and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky  felonystudded situation  
its intended as a sort of hard days night  but ends up simply hard to watch  
basically  what we have is a cliched copbuddy movie  rife with all the clich  s of that genre  
the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon  in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof   
now  look  i dont know whose idea this was  but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tonguelashing  
the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself  and they didnt try to overachieve  
they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers  
mattys lady is played by french actress b  atrice dalle  arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout  not that you needed to know that  but it lends credence to the idea that ferraras entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout  
the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance  but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist  christopher george   
still  i suppose that if youre looking for a movie that is  so bad its good   you could do worse than bats  
hard to say  
the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold  art jeffries  bruce willis   is confronted with his own failure  
needless to say the acting is far from top notch  nor does necessity ask that it should be  
his pecs  however  are impressive  and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off  
no film should be discarded because its content  because film is never about what its about  its about how its about  as the old cliche goes   
while emotionally unconvincing  the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role  perking up the movie like an injection of antidepressant  
none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in  fargo   a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point   and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience  
and theres really not much style  
1   why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs  and how do those eggs fuse into one beast  
his dad  kevin kilner  is away on business and his mom  haviland morris  has to run errands  so  for the most part  hes all by himself during the day  
it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself  
i could imagine that during filming  west would shoot a scene  then take the actors aside and tell them   lets do it again  but this time  i want more   
in a typical cinematic high school  the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them  but not before the boys scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books

it features a character who literally rises from his grave  a woman who has a phone conversation with god  and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character  to an almost humorous drunk  
seemingly suffering from a long psychosis  when he feels as if his secret is about to be exposed  he is apt to take extreme measures to cover up his tracks

the only person in the movie whos the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend  maurice evans  who calls mia up to give her the bad news  and immediately falls into a coma

its nothing more than a special effectsextravaganza  visually impressive  but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesnt engage  
my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas  both almost 9  gave the show     
but  im inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as its box office numbers suggest  
the dialogue is the best of this mess  lines like jon lovitz exclaiming  i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs   
the blandly nice odonnell couldnt pull off a randy cad if he tried  so the filmmakers dont even let him  zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to  but no one dares make her anything but the woman  lightly  wronged  
now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai

mr  taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes  while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone  it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived  witness such lines as  you should have asked something more interesting  like do you enjoy the pain   
the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat  dr  evil  mike myers  in the second of his three roles   having constructed a time machine  goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin powers  mojo   dont you just love that word   
while they do bring us eyepopping special effects that will amaze you  they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies  a storyline

one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters  all of which have next to nothing to do and arent even given multidimensional characters to attempt to develop  
while i probably shouldnt blame this on van der beek  since the inauspicious and  bythenumbers  screenplay by w  peter iliff isnt of any help  he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in  all the right moves

i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film  but whatever it was  it just didnt work  
frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do  
what he does with this film is  are you sure you want to read this   
their three female counterparts fare noticeably better  
she tells him to fuck off or something to that note  
its directed by reitman  clearly trying to parlay his  ghostbusters  success into a twentyfirstcentury counterpart  
the dialogue stinks  
rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed  dull  cardboard secondary characters  especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonists various interactions with them  
theyre both unbelievably wooden

the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even  try  writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions

you can really write the script from here on by yourself    as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had  but things continue to go bad for him  there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village  there is no chef to replace his wife  as the restaurant is about to close for good

meanwhile  steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy  
there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced  but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat  
but we do not really see much of that digging  
before its too late  
only williams stands out  while still performing on the level of his humorfree comedy rocket man   but that is because hes imprisoned throughout most of the film  giving a much needed change of pace  but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another   
be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well  
yes  
all the performers have to work with a soppy script  that tries its best to get some emotion going  but never takes off the ground  
eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair  but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon  and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart

other than director russ meyers predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the aforementioned anatomical areas  there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie

barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over  car crashes  explosions  broken glass and slowmotion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death

the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship  proclaiming to brackett in the third person   hes gay

robbie hart  adam sandler  used to want to be a rock and roll star  but in 1985 hes singing at weddings and having a good time  
the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it  
it also has violence  obviously  
in the last ten minutes or so  for some inexplicable reason  things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been  like the trailer teases

good music to be sure  but it doesnt replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the storyit makes the film somewhat minimalistic  a technique i rarely admire  
the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made  last action hero   1993  such a chore to sit through

its two successors have been pale imitations  amounting to hundredmilliondollar bgrade horror movies  
the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal  whos nephew  played by michael rappaport  is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths

mel brooks does not take advantage of this  however  and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air  none of which connect and none of which are explained later on  
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense  owing everything it is to stephen frears 1988 masterpiece

ultimately  it doesnt really matter what i  or any other critic  for that matter  have to say about the movie  
directed by christopher mcquarrie  the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects  an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles  this one included   way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity

random hearts two primary characters seem to live in shells  
many people will continue to write this movie  over and over again  
furthermore  the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence  
i didnt agree with that assessment  but i could see what was being implied  the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout  do er  man  do er   
with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino  everyone who appeared in  i  the jury  were upandcomers who basically went nowhere

certain things in our lives are inevitable  
the cast is just as ineffective  
my rating  out of 5   no stars

it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares  
instead  i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me  too  
but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multitiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level  bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same  
the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new years eve birthday  
im big fan of perrys subtle sense of humor  and in addition  i think chris farleys onedge  extreme acting was a riot  
i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting sendoff  
francis is in almost every scene  but we learn very little about him  as if the film was distancing itself away from him when  i suspect  we were actually supposed to sympathize with him

but he gets unexpected help from the house itself  
 a rapist  matt frewer  responds to supergirls  helen slater  query as to why shes being attacked  an example of the mindnumbingly bad dialogue in supergirl  
the opening sequence alone in a seemingly uninterrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes  an homage to hitchcocks  rope    as we are introduced to all of the characters  
the plot  which has mr  freeze and poison ivy  uma thurman  planning to take over gotham city and then  the vorld   as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states   is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust  partnership  blah  blah  blah  
filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains  
the films secret is hohum at best  and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is  
when the family pulls in a goofy lipsynch to cheer someone up  
with teary music  
one touching scene early on is worth mentioning  
the supporting characters are remarkably flat  and insultingly ridiculous as well  
furthermore  its even more curious that this film is rated pg  which  by definition  rules out any sex or explicit violence  
everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous  
dr  susan tyler  sorvino  creates a genetically enhanced bug  the judas breed   however  which is designed to kill all cockroaches

but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster  
you get the  talking killer  plot deviceyou know the scenario  the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age  
and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her  
take it all off    
most of them wont make it to med school  though  and its obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains   i wish to hell theyd put a radio on that train   
pacinos comical portrayal is spirited  but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie  
and to be fair  it is almost never really boring  as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story

failed all around  
after all  the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superheroaction genre and kept the corny deathdefying stunts to a minimum  while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony

  have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming   
status  ro 
there are some flaws with the plot also  as the characters do the complete opposite to logical  presumably to keep the story exciting  and also the fact that the story just isnt strong enough to sustain the audiences attention  
he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity  to the extent which that can be done   and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie  
if boorman is anything  hes ambitious  and when he succeeds  its in grand fashion  
he finally gets some  though  but strangely enough  he ends up looking like his brother

what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water  and its a shame because it could have been a great film  
i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say  is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one  able to recognize mothers faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself  
its understandable  especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources  
all this anguish  pain  halfbaked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo  who steals the show and derives joy from his character  which is basically a compilation of soso one liners  
i must say  matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla  
capshaws character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies  but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely onedimensional  
savvy holiday goers should skip  102 dalmatians  and pop the original 1961 animated classic into  their  vcrs instead  
not only is home alone 3 unnecessary  but its offensive  
its pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when  
  judging by the costuming at the end of the movie  the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in reinventing polyester   
theater rating      good seats  sound  and picture 
likewise  some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film  
there is such a herkyjerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even kings sharp dialogue cant prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour

editors note  for some reason though  the day after my screening i converted to scientology  
  i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the doublejeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick  
some real excitement  i suppose  
also  if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things  
hes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins  but he is effective both in being naughty and nice  
  the acting is truly bad

the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford  
its too bad that  hush  is so laughable  because the onscreen talent  including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange  is nothing to laugh at  
scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions  
exciting  
joke wise  we are thankfully  spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor  
the screenplay is lamely written  and the subject matter poorly conceived  
theres nothing new here  its jurassic park meets aliens  with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure  
she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite  the sound of music  on her car stereo  intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims

the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad  
apparently  a subplot involving a tryst between zetajones and taylors characters was filmed but removed  
  snake eyes  is the most aggravating kind of movie  the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing

ben gets emotionally involved with alessa  
mulder and scully know  the truth is out there   and so try to expose both the invasion and the coverup  
it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered  that  thankfully  never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition  
all too obviously  were getting the hollywood watered down version  
as maggie  ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right  
of course  jane is hot on her ape mans heals  
its movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question   what the hell were they thinking     
whether or not they save the day  i will not reveal  
it still possesses enough of lynchs stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative scifi  
as it is  though  he plays the character completely serious at some moments  and for laughs at others  
in one of the only subplots that actually works  due to its wittiness  henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman  
if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l  mankiewicz was  hed be    well  
costner and  especially  wrightpenn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring  
its a serial killerhorror film farce of nonstop overthetop action and sleaze  involving decapitations  vampires  biker fights  extended gun play  and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed  
a  shadow government  is aware of this  but tries to coverup the alien existence  
and at that point  the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was  never  going to introduce a plot of some sort  
since none of the respectable actors in  payback  actually have human beings to play  only one performance managed to stand out  
the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue  
the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious  neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters  
on top of that debacle  the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramangas  funhouse   
zak orth  as the newly realized porn star monk  shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the films intelligent dialogue  
bad boys is a dry run  and overlong  too  clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more byplay than i felt could be justified  
if theyre trying for another mary poppins  they need to find a team that can produce one  and then give them a chance to do it  
it rocksactually  lots of rocks fly at us or from us  in slow or fast motion  at several points in the film  
its 100minute running time feels like 100 years  
this subplot was alright  but it was quite annoying with stephies accent  
violence is bad  
at first  i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes  but when the movie got rolling  my interest suddenly stopped  
i dont think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning  
thats not to say that philip eisner  here making his feature filmwriting debut  doesnt have talent  
a subplot involves philips attempts to win back sara  whos angry at him  and with good reason   but who is being seduced by who is basically philips belloq  wilson croft  christopher mcdonald  playing the hysterically suaveyetunsuave asswhole once again   
his response was a big lecture of how this is that  and that is this    he 
when  even in the beginning  the director cant get the small parts right  you can sense the movie is in trouble  
yes  although hes an obviously klutzy moron  nasa doesnt think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program  and time itself  has ever known  
maybe it looked good on paper  
not content with the tooobvious  heathers  heisting  the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources  including  carrie    bride of frankenstein    blue velvet   and even shaws pygmalion  itself recently remade as  shes all that   
as a third outing  the island of dr  moreau 
id like to actually watch a film in focus  but again  they failed to deliver that as well  
in fact  the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film  
to place the blame squarely at van dammes feet  however  is an injustice  
based on a series of comic books   virus  concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat  which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon  
id seen con air  which despite being completely implausible  was still great fun  because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix  
robin williams is an amazing actor  
the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive  
this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalmas  blow out   where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions  
movie parodies are crammed in at an almostsubliminal rate  but most are empty  
roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast   who would have guessed that the most savage maddog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by    
he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger  in a terrific role  and tries to save this girl leading to an ending thats satisfying  but turns into a typical action movie  
in fact  i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time  despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story  
bye bye love is rarely funny  more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tvmovie fare  
  shining  had class  style  story  acting  but most of all talent and originality  
critique  the truth is that if i didnt have a day job  i would probably watch the real  jerry springer  show every day  
at one point caan laments  need is the ultimate monkey  a line so inexplicable he might as well have said  love is like hippo ass   
well trust me  youll feel the same way  
thank god for the fast forward button  
the director is paul verhoven  
the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy  and the accompanying emotional swings  is not funny  
  i  change the venue into  the big city   
as directed by chris weitz and paul weitz  codirectors of  american pie  and costars of  chuck  buck    the whole affair comes off as amateur hour  
liz is everyones favorite because shes both beautiful and kind  
synopsis  backup quarterback moxxon becomes starting quarterback midway through his senior year of high school  even though hed rather read  slaughterhouse five  than the playbook  
the director asks for little from his actors  which is precisely what he gets  
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie  
kattans comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium  
but why give him a more serious material  
he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance  
whala you have  end of days  a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific  
i doubt it  
tv shows should do just that stay on tv  it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers  
notice the scenes sole shocking scene  where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion  myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene  and a couple others  that some of us whove only seen him on tv never saw  and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails  
youll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties  
next thing  she cries rape  
but this film doesnt let that happen  
only a quick cameo from norm macdonald  and a follow up joke during the closing credits  generates any chuckles  
the design of the beast is funky  if not very memorable  
an explosion  
let the characters interaction sans swords and shields  however  and theres still a struggle  for the audience to follow or even care about the story  
his old associates want him for one last job and send the vicious don to give him an offer he cant refuse  
so bad  its almost good  
residents are advised to evacuate the area  asap  
i woke up early the day i died is a perfectly bad film  
i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews  and in both instances  he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon  
he wants to show everything in a weird manner  and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about  
its confounding  
if caught  they risk losing all the money  and their love  
but those moments are rare and in the end patch adams is barely average  
and as expected  everyone turns the tables on poor al  
straitlaced med student josh  tom everett scott  who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout  s blemishfree academic record breaks out into fs  thanks to the influence of his everpartying roommate  cooper  markpaul gosselaar   who introduces josh to the sex and boozefilled nights that come with university life  
peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom  and bernard bresslaws character appears only briefly in the film  
i couldnt stand any of those characters  
the plot is jumbled and illogical  not to mention excruciatingly sluggish  
halfway through the film  i didnt necessarily find myself enjoying the film  but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation  
but the story is so poorly told that any message  subliminal or otherwise  is totally undetectable  
5  the comedy is not funny  
the music is meandering  except near the end  
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldnt be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie  
while in most of his famed films  his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot  
toward the end  for example  brooke has her suspicions about daryl  
no joy or entertainment value can be derived from any of the events of the film  
the rest of actors are most unnoteworthy  
couldnt she just go to the gap and take suggestions  
i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night  but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies  
sure  hes a suitably creepy villain  know why  
the films plot doesnt have one original bone in its body  andagainyou have to point your finger at the screenwriting  
why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devils number  666   well  
they all drive fast cars  look ohsofabulous even in the morning  and dont seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men  having buildings explode ten feet in front of them  or flying through the air in matrix slowmotion  
and who  may i ask  will pay for it  
but i suppose we all need to put food on the table  
cast members michael ontkean  sherilyn fenn  piper laurie  and richard beymer are sorely missed  not to mention lara flynn boyle  who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna  
some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little  while others actually have some clue as to what happened  
a dead friend of the cop  
worst of all  godzilla isnt even exciting  
i didnt laugh  but for some reason it didnt annoy me that much  
this movie  in fact  makes other recent soso horror films like urban legend and john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works of high art  
he even stoops so low to put them into childrens toys  
this reminded me of another action director  renny harlin  die hard 2  cliffhanger   
the acid test for high school movies is  does it at all capture the feel of what its portraying  
another telltale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the heros costume more than the hero  
and to add insult to injury  the supposedly dead  regretfully  often turn out not to be so  
sure  some of the bits are absurdly funny  including a mens room macarena joke  the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels  and an all dorothy marching band performing  over the rainbow  at a gay mens march  
for instance  cant hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as  i am a sex machine   
in fact  it downplays it so heavily its totally unbelievable  
if you sign on to do a movie  then do it the way the script calls for  
naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations  
  trumpet of the swan  features flat background art  some poor sound syncing and insipid  sugary songs  
as the movie marks time until its big finale  it throws in some repugnant scenes  hoping to turn audiences stomachs  
there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something  
no  his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing  
for dream with the fishes  though  i did find myself on the flip side of coin  often hoping that the film would quickly conclude  and that the nick character would just hurry up and die  
rose macgowan is horrible  
either way  he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie  
  meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood    
  his first lol line is to ms  bullock   id like to boogie with you    
jeanclaude van damme has a oneliner early on in universal soldier  the return  his latest attempt to remain relevant  that sums up this entire movie  he says  been there  done that   
mcfarlanes  spawn  immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s  
dave foley isnt given enough to do  as well as  will  graces  megan mullally who can be funny  
as for nudity  it is very sparse  but at least we get to see angela zimmerly  far and away the most attractive cast member  before her body is bruised  torn  and bloodied by the dragging incident  
a slutty woman  karin viard   who lives with the butcher and only wants his meat  
rock does get the chance to do some fun schtick  such as his turnaround on wellingtons plans for a poor neighborhood hospital  bullet in the head  
the protagonist of the movie is jack  played by jeff fahey   yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford  played by bo derek   
the politics of the film are scary  
this results in a significant amount of parody  which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster  and ends up just producing a mess  
awwwww  
but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up  its no big deal  
  evelyn c  leeper  approved  eclmtcts1  att  com 
for a scientist  this is very poor observation  
the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery  
every time frakes gives an interview lately  he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment  
i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office  chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director   welcome to america  
sadly   virus  does not deliver  on any level  
the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so  the time mr  connery is on the screen for  is worth watching  
since jack has been deceased for a whole year  you would think there would be many questions to ask him  such as   what happens after you die   
they are idiots  and were expected to root for them  
this is a miscalculation  as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in  
unfortunately it doesnt get much more formulaic than one tough cop  
meanwhile  gibson  who is perfectly fine here  sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging  
if youre a big fan of the group  you probably wont get enough of what you want  and if youre not a big fan  you get too much time devoted to nothing more than  look at us  moments  
i love uma thurman  
more than anything in this film  this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil  
rated pg13  
mind erasing aliens  find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy  
not really  
remarkably levinson and hoffmans other currently showing film is  wag the dog   a smart and entertaining piece of work  
skipping over to the acting  the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress  no offense  she has been good simon birch and even very good to great kiss the girls at times  in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better    
both those films were tense exercises in chills  
but how did he possibly think this was a good movie  
here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around  its completely worthless  
its production values may be high  but the writing is frequently appalling  and instead of a script has a collection of references  injokes and illdefined characters  
despite its own peculiar flaws  then  the extended version of dune is a generally superior film  
but  then again  what do i know about business  
plot  a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients  
they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept  but executed it terribly  
explosions are fun  
events are predictable from the time that the setups are made  and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here  
its painfully idealistic  manipulative  and silly  
i feel whatever else you can say about a film  bad script bad music  etc   if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said  
gene gives ebert a thumbs down at the end of the film  
that picture was weird  but some critics claim its one of the best movies of the 80s  
one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner  but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love  
and bedazzled  need i say more   is a roast of hollywood and celebrity  sure  but its not a funny one  
the soundtrack is decent and imperial teens catchy  yoo hoo  makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film  
but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality  as everything seemed staged and unemotional  
through a plot twist  hoenickers goons  named smith and wesson  ha ha  what a great sense of humor this film has  who are played by clancy brown and ted levine  both who needed the pay check   discover it the hard way  and try to steal for hoenicker  who wants it just cause hes evil enough  
sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum  doesnt it  
but it goes wrong  
i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy  but the tvconversionmovies are hitting our screens like wildfire  sad to say  with mixed success  
kudrow isnt given enough time to create a full personality with maddy  so it isnt her fault she doesnt register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue  
these are all topics that could easily fill a movie  
this film is just there  
i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquettes tag team partner is macho man randy savage  
meanwhile  marcs spoiled  hetero  female roommate  cynthia  mara hobel   spends her days lying about their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown  
one of the most blatantly obvious signs that oftenacclaimed director sidney lumets  gloria   a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film  had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre  
i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal  and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not  
that is why this film suffers  
garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator  jay o  sanders  running for reelection  
is extremely silly  
the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler  barry peppers  is selected as the slave groups leader  
sound like a good  complete movie  
when long decides to investigate  theres nothing but trouble  
its all pretty tame stuff  but max ends up in hot water when dad nixes the move  leaving his son dangling in the wind like so many tampon strings  
  oh  how witty   
it is a serious film  seriously flawed if you ask me  but i digress  which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake  but overall  just sits there  
myers  in his first straight character part  is in turn appealing and appalling  
in this rrated  for explicit sexual language   pseudohip battle of the sexes  the audience loses  
i also liked james cromwell  mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous  
odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him  almost as if he has a grudge to settle  
he joins fellow martial artistaction star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away  
none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered  whenever that was   
at the outset of swordfish  john travoltas gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today  
and lets not forget all the guards on death row  who also happen to be angels from the heaven above  except for one cookiecutter crazy guard who is also evil personified  and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates      
which brings us to the performances  of which theres nothing good that can be said  
the actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death  
his performance is incredibly lazy  although his paperthin character doesnt deserve more than the performance he gives  
why a child psychologist  
the casting director must have chose him because hes scottish like alec guinness  theres little other explanation for it

this  
unfortunately  faye dunaways energetic  at times ridiculously overthetop performance is about the films only redeeming feature  
maybe im becoming a softy  
if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue  its only fair to quote some of it  but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like  joe isnt happy   
one survived  
its just chris odonnell running from 100  000 obnoxious  greedy  angry and stupid women  
unfortunately  six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels  even the presence of its original director didnt stop the rapid decline of the quality  
but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all  let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level  
well  this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable scifi thriller  
one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos  
instead  it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army  
so we only see snippets of snuff  and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror  
thats it

interestingly  their professions are given  but we not once ever see them working at their jobs  or  for that matter  learn much of anything about them  
it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster  
suddenly  amanda finds her restaurant  on the edge of foreclosure  rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food  which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths  
first  we have the prison warden subplot  
one thing that comes to mind the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark  namely his atomic breath  
if it is  then the director and writers have made the wrong move  because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest  
from then the action ensues    
before that  he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants  
i know this is an odd question  but remember the opening music of  police academy 4  citizens on patrol   when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song  citizens on patrol  during the opening credits  
it basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit  
there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either  and besides degeneres wisecracks  theres little that is even a little amusing  
she is clearly a talented  charismatic actress  but has never been given a good role in her life  usually having to settle for a onedimensional supporting character  as in  1997s   nothing to lose   and   addicted to love   
the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is   i hate that mouse   
even a science fiction film must be internally consistent  
jim carreys signed on too  
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him  
  you know  for kids   norville barnes 
certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written  
sadly  his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier  the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo  
it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human  
modernizing the classics is currently in vogue  just see william shakespeares romeojuliet   
in de palmas latest  he turns his attention to stanley kubrick  
like last years the thin red line  its a movie by a director who doesnt know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway  
i cant stress enough how every single element  whether it be a character  the dialogue  a plot  twist   etc   is so damn generic that youll wonder if  anyone  is working behind the scenes  let alone in front of the camera  
since its rarely funny or convincingly dramatic  what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery  
are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get  
while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19  
this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided   screw it  lets just kill everybody   
im not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline  but it seems like 10  000  000  000  
but  hell  its not as if hes the only problem in this wellintentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller  
he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive  
a bearded black hole exists where dennis quaid should be  
never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie  
almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to coscript writer billy crystal  who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while cohosting  comic relief  charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg  two other paragons of selfindulgence   
so the batologist  her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff  lou diamond phillips  have to kill all the bats and save the world  
part of the reason why the film doesnt work  i think  is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was a comingofage stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness  
there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film  
despite some anxiety and caution from others  luke accepts entry into the organization  
for that reason alone  it is worth a look  just to realize how bad a movie can be  
hungry for recognition  micelli sets up interviews  lectures  etc  in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history  a sure fire way to go down in the history books  
  wing commander  s story  credited to roberts and screenwriter kevin droney  is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative and unoriginal ideas  
she chooses her past  and sacrifices not only her new life but her old  by giving up her and eddies daughter to joey   
3  the music  
a person can only take so much  
it is an old plot dressed up to look new  
there is enough shocking death  graphic gore  and requisite black humor to provide the essential  roller coaster  type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick  
this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time  not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre   
  by the way  speaking of british tv   red dwarf  fans should look for chris  rimmer  barrie in his first major film role   
no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story  
the romantic elements are all contrived  in fact  lady janes presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance  
  the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs  white than black vs  black   
even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parentchild relationships  it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off  because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family breakups and their effects on children  
there was really no super affects at all  unless you consider an invisible devil  who was in it for 5 minutes tops  worth the overpriced budget  
an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger  more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman  bob gunton   coles former cia boss  brian cox  and deals involving chemical weapons  
unfortunately there are no deep characters  and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it  
since foley belongs to the former  his character had to watch his language  and the tone of the film in general is more infantile  
while  we are told  in the black community  the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur  riding around in fancy cars  flashing wads of money  dressed in a flamboyant style  where his snakegaiter shoes might cost him a grand  and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community  
the story is painfully dull and mindnumbingly cliched  hands up who  wouldnt  guess heman and skeletor take their fight into the real world  and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors  dolph lundgren as heman for one  or good actors  james tolkan  meg foster  given such awful characters and dialogue that they cant help but seem terrible  
the script doesnt know what the hell to do with them  
and unfortunately with mans best friend  well be waiting a while longer  
if you are able to get through the opening halfhour  in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them  you will surely survive the rest  
so last week i opened up the new york times  and  no surprise  boys and girls got a negative review  
meanwhile  killer carl stargher  vincent donofrio  has claimed another victim  
caan slips into this role with seeming ease  he could do this kind of softspoken tough guy in a coma  but he manages to give his character depth and weariness  
in one shot  a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall  but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air  
if you are really interested in seeing andersons talents  however  i suggest you skip over this dud and watch the infamous pam and tommy lee honeymoon sex tape  now available on home video

bythenumbers  a film which introduces characters  situations  dilemmas and developments that weve seen before in a parade of other films  
peter hyams does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well  
for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls locker room undetected  
billy crystal plays sam cayman  an agent who  at the beginning of the film  is in romania  
freshly moved to atlanta  jermaine  dourdan  and his wife  jasmine  moore   have the trappings of a perfect life  
five years after this movie hit theaters  hanks  ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better  although still subpar romantic comedy youve got mail  which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet  
its an archetypal postapocalyptic plot full of promise  
hes selfadmittedly guilty and should be sent to jail  no matter how moral his crusade  
this film serves no purpose  
and the special effects  
the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a  really  big gun  
on its surface  it appears to be a kids film  
its also a depressing waste of talent  with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles  not to mention oncecool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of notcool flicks  this thriller is more  before and after  than  reversal of fortune   
she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soontobecomebeleaguered vanni  
reviews of nearly all mainstream movies playing today  
the current whizquizkid is stanley spector  jeremy blackman in his film debut  who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits  
i feel sorry for the financial backers of  waterworld   which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made  at 172 million    and is also one of the stupidest  boy did they get ripped off  
this is a frantic movie  all sweaty closeups  wideangle lenses  dutch tilts and otherworldly lighting schemes  
its a veritable  alpha centuri 90210  as we watch the lovesmitten teens squabble in the name of love  
review by david wilcock  1998 
and wouldnt it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though its so blatantly real bad porn that ive completely convinced myself that its not  
theres one good gag right before the credits  but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued  
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the originals rawhidestand by your man medley  the music is very much enjoyable  
the movie hasnt got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas  its just trying to find convenient ways to stall us  
as ive already said  this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap  badly acted  and badly written than campy  
nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning  which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath  
unfortunately  in  the big hit   it seems that comedy is the main motive  and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs  
this 83minute vignette is something of a horror show  but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end  
the plot  cribbed greatly from  2001   concerns a team sent to mars  the first manned trip ever made to the red planet  
his performance is a great break away from the gloom  and hes just purely enjoyable to watch  
among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a treecovered mountainside in a boat  and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle  
george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin  being overshadowed by the villains  and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film  
it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones  
even dumb movies can do that for me  sometimes  
rec  arts  sf  reviews  710 
for instance  the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film  small soldiers  
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long  long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down  
lastly  i am proud to say that i caught a significant gaffe in the film  
i may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments   
maybe it was funny andor respectable in the 60s    
rendered in wartime demotic  that should have been expressed as  who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him   
the supporting cast do their best aswell  with rex linn as a doubting sheriff  and the other kidnappers  
after his last hit  dogma  he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess  
the main problem though is that its just not funny  
it has a vivid soundmix  
in these cases  a  plot   which is generally very thin  is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags  i  e  
then  theres moore  leland orser  who speaks 5 lines and walks around with a puzzled look on his face  
and the plot  
sure  theres a lot of sex and nudity  but its almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a womans abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free  splattering blood and gore in all directions  
nine months is a predictable cookiecutter movie with no originality in humor or plot  
how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee  
a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesnt deserve to be fully lambasted  
to anyone familiar with computers andor the internet  most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you cant take it anymore  
walking over to greet him  he is horrified to discover it is jimmy  the tulip  tudeski  bruce willis   a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison  
this is bythenumbers plotting  buddy movieroad movie redux  
they have stories where the socalled hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight  chase or shoot at  
ok  he really didnt  but he should have  
even she cant force taplitz to decide whose story this is  or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite  
playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on  
movies dont come much more ridiculously titled than  i still know what you did last summer   but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous  the title sort of works as a warning  
to call  jawbreaker  garbage would be to insult garbage  
im not talking about snuff films  supposed  documentaries  of victims being brutalized and killed on camera  
thanks to this movie  the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do  
      one of the top few films of this or any year  
now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder  so everyone has nightmares    or 
even his old associate  music composer ry cooder  disappoints  with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic  
it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u  s  television  
in a case like that  the showdown just ends up being a letdown  
we spent all of this money making big special effects  and weve gotta get this movie out by summer or its going to bomb in our faces  
none of these scenes really work  because arnie isnt up to the task  
he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mothers leg  
gwyneth paltrow doesnt have much to build upon  as helens only character trait seems to be  daughterinlaw   
9  its pathetic attempt at  improving  on a shakespeare classic  
although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons  i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise  ive always been a sucker for surprise endings  my favorite movie is the usual suspects  and rarely dislike a film that sports one  
the legend of 1900s is the years most absurd movie  a rambling  nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast  
the problems start with jennifer beales  who never registers as the plots femme fatale  
this kind of physical humor is dead  
sir anthony hopkins isnt given much better material to work with  unfortunately  
by the time the sighinducing climax hits  the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater  
in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carries onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating  
shes the only one in the film who could act  
in fact  youd be better off waiting to blow your disposable income when the real kiddie pics  monsters  inc   harry potter  come out next month  
mind you  if you enjoyed that films shrugoftheshoulders ending  you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well  
it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life  
but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smiths fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it  
batman  george  and robin  chris  fight him a bit but find theyre growing apart  
the film enjoys a few inspired moments  the urn scene  a session of nude bowling  the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip  but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between  and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes  
the production is set on mars in 2176  where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world  
it feels like the matrix  mission  impossible 2  and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one  
i chuckled incessantly  all the way home  
my reaction  hohum  
jade comes off a bit sympathetically  but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy  
a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining knowhow  
so  how do we do that   
  detroit rock city  is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the films existence  and its not a very satisfying realization  
when the leads hide from their pursuers  arthur covers maurices mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze  
a better title for this nostalgic mess would be  50 missed opportunities   
the answer is quite simple  i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary  
robin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way  
another of franciss favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities  
in this film  they just made me more confused  
ya know  the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky  
that actually is the whole storyline  
written by randy turgeon  march 18  1998  
perhaps its her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person  or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before  
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions  
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2  35  1  is enhanced for 16x9 televisions  and has been remastered in full thx glory  
the love story between han  jet li  and trish  aalyah   and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified  
danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep  as evidenced by  my socalled life   but shes saddled with a mysteriousboyfriend  josh brolin  subplot so seethrough you begin to seriously question her socalled intelligence  
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and  although not al pacino  he is fun to behold  
the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackals plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy  
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers trail and each make different offers to get the mother back  
he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who  according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley  used to work as a guard in the indian casino  
one night  during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets  we went to see  what else  hard rain  
from that point on  the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from  jaws  and  dead calm   
but  ollie  old sage  do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade  
ok enough already get on with it  
they begin fight club  an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging  
drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers  screenwriter kevin williamson  of scream 2 credit  gives us a horror tale set in middle america  ohio  one eventful fall  
the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a highconcept movie plot  
  he should have been around 70 years old   
poor  poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting  but all he is a halfassed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been  
but the contest doesnt end there  guys and gals  
it turns out  what else   that the data in johnnys head could save a lot of people  but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesnt kill him  
in the original movie  the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities  
during the basketball scene  the coach for the rival team actually says   i think they might be cheating   to which the referee replies   theres no rules about jumping too high   
even with the performances of bates and winkler  there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie  
no  he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says  we need to talk about this right now   
hes a good cop  as the first few scenes establish  and hes very familiar with chinatown  
if there is a movie you would prefer never to see  i believe the avengers would be a good choice  
soon enough though  spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad  being chased by the allofasuddensuperhuman facinelli  
the plot is incomprehensible  
finally  this is commercial television  
this new movie however is nothing but garbage  there is nothing good to it storywise  and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors  
not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a tripledigit i  q   but it doesnt bother to give any of the onscreen individuals even a hint of depth  
christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate  respectively  
theres a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute  whose daughter is being held hostage  for some reason  by the villain  
and strangely enough  he is the first character to get the ax    literally  
someone near cellphoneguy did eventually yell   shut the hell up    but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen  
the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular  seamlessly blending computergenerated imagery with the western surroundings  
unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care  not the writer  the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off  
your first clue that something isnt gonna be quite right with the movie youre about to see  its heavily christmasthemed and its release date is  oh  say  at the end of february  
some of the action scenes are fine  which should be credited to director stephen hopkins  predator ii  judgement night   
gibson recovers from multiple gunshots  is pissed  naturally   and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back  no more  no less  
greg is playing a game he does not understand  in a league he is new to  
but now im rambling on again about the negative things  arent i  
believe me  we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years  
theyre also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises  
this creature  dubbed  eve  by its creator  dr  laura baker  played by marg helgenberger  reprising her role   is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile  
the only common occurrence that doesnt take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement  but then that would have made them believable  
does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this  
the continuity department was obviously asleep  along with the viewers  when watching this film  
take a look at l  a  confidential  or the films more likely inspiration  the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled  
this first shows up as powder visits the world of high school  if hes such a genius already  why would he need a high school education   and sits through a demonstration in jeff goldblums science class  
boy  schumacher is really really getting on my nerves  
his characters dont communicate anything of interest to each other  so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera  
while far from the best of actors  he is certainly not horrible  and he is a charismatic presence  
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased  action lovers wont be bored  and the catholic league will be angry  
it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights  
the moment i first saw martha  i started looking for fangs  
this talented young actress reads her lines with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film  
hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires  explosions  knives and chains appearing out of nowhere  glowing eyes  or constantly transforming demons  
its a satire  and a sometimes funny one  about how we let handphones  callwaiting and answering machines run our lives  
see it twice  
his movie is produced anthologystyle  telling the same story from multiple  three  points of view  much as an author might write a serial novel  
but a new  more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies  
the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige  
armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla  
i tried to keep an open mind while watching it  but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes  
next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past  take great pleasure in reminding him of his future  
schmidt  who is in cahoots with karens sleazy parole officer  gailard sartain   again wants karen to help him stage a robbery  
the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schraders  hardcore   in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter  
as in almost every summer movie  there are some interesting scenes  but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects  
as the assault begins  our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon  
 not rated  
more specifically  it follows the exploits of dade murphy  a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller  
what else is there  
ten years later their son steven  played by bradley gregg   who was blinded during the incident  still runs motel together with his older brother ray  played by craig sheffer   
their method is amusingly innovative  the bloodsuckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks  
he is so horrible in this role that one cant help but be amused  
  joe is way too big for that cage   
the rationale is sound  but in many cases of this and recent years  the sequel is a shoddy product thats exposed for the cashmilking vehicle it really is  
it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours  floats around  goes away  hopefully never to be heard from again  
it strikes  wraps around you  holds you tighter than your true love  
how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy  
elmer bernsteins score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn notefornote from a vintage noir  
the film stars eddie murphy as a mysticalish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs  jeff goldblum and kelly preston  with a flat tire on their hands  
2  the poster  
here  we dont even hate the bugs  whats there to hate  
overall  if i have to quantify it  i say  rising action gets     and climax and falling action gets  
for 90 minutes  
thats like sending a mouse into a cat carrier  isnt it  
hudson  as a prettyinpink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies man  jay mohr   trips  pukes and gets smeared with dog poop  
i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot  
block would like his son hilly  eric lloyd  to accompany him  but hillys mother  previously first harrys psychiatrist and more recently his wife  refuses to let her son see his father  
he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court  
the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget  while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares  
and although there is no chemistry between the two leads  they give good performances on their own  
its also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies  pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases  
so then he thought   let me wait another five years  get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes     
while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original  it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died  
this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film  because it doesnt look or feel like an almod  var film  the type of film it aspired to be  but more like a film that was interferred with from above  
count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger  willem dafoe  basquiat   
susanne and daniel must then decide where to hide from evil art thieves who shoot everyone else in the mansion to steal paintings  
 this story might have been done much better as a tenminute animated film  
the photography in this film is dark  setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it  
it just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring  we dont only have aliens to worry about  but now we have joness conscience  
he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party  
viewers of televisions  in living color  know this oneman cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill  
the thriller business itself is ridiculous  it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs  and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor  
ditto for keaton  who is serving a double shift as costar and director  a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle  
it doesnt help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable  
  its no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year  this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week  with some nudity stuffed in from time to time  just to wake up the audience  
theres a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow  
and the list goes on

the problems begin with their initial courtship  which does virtually nothing to establish julias character and merely establishes that kevin is a wiseass  
one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon  although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again

unfortunately  this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film  which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended

there are some bright spots  though  
they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie  
after being shot  handcuffed  and thrown in the back seat of a car  she still manages to cause an accident  kick out the windshield with her legs  grab a suitcase full of money  plus some important documentation   climb through the rubble  land on her shot leg  and still succeed at running for safety

the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out  since we dont see her from the midpoint on

joel schumachers direction of batman and robin is horrific  with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance  
the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass  formulaic approach which disallows creativity  
this scene is set in 1871  
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the ninefilm series  i got exited  
todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo  
so  naturally  when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found  this notion left me puzzled

this movie is based off the wildly popular videogame series of the same name  
  the glaring miniatures should show better on video  though  
dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholsons joker  while costner just plain rips  
he was pensive  resourceful and had relationships  which made our perspective on him equally human  
the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent  
it got great reviews  
one character actually was interesting  
it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence  
virtual seduction has many faults  one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins   
the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but

during the finale  when we are finally introduced to the translucent  conehead  kittyfaced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from  we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film  just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn   
  
its just too funny  
jason biggs right off the flop  loser  does an ok job playing silverman  but he is stale and flat at times  
luckily for us all  this mess only lasts about 80 minutes  and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a leadfaced detective  
the dialogue is warbling  and basically just repeats the same points over and over  no matter who is delivering them  
look  the new version of  psycho  came out and the world didnt end

his quest is ended  as apparently angels dont have wings and are approachable  and god  well     
let me rage here just for a minute  
hey  jim  heads up  
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film  we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another  just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside  
however  when an amorous young couple takes a skinnydip in the local hot springs  they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath  
however  the subplot never fully materializes  and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion  
yea  
i almost avoided this film because i did not like the original  
unfortunately  i still knows characters arent all that funny  
its aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more  could be totally intelligent  and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely    then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of halfassedness  
beautiful  110   my best friends wedding  710   notting hill  510   pretty woman  710  runaway bride  510   someone like you  410   wedding planner  310   when harry met sally  1010   youve got mail  410  
a ruthless villain  
now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel  
some stuff happens in the middle of the movie  but i cant remember most of it  because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen  
in this decade  the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills  which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film  simply doesnt work  
i shift uncomfortably in my seat  
it  s not that it  s gore is unique  it  s just like other gory animes  but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it  s story  characters  animation  etc    
if its good enough for doctors to draw blood from  then why do vampires stray from that sight   
2  the television show never gives us any answers  
and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch  
the film starts promisingly enough  with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols problem  greens put together a first rate soundtrack  and yes  i laughed a few times  
the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning  
fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess  they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again  
  star trek  insurrection   is perhaps the weakest film in the  star trek   series  although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst   star trek v  the final frontier   
the most interesting part of  cant hardly wait  just happens to be not only the most human  but for many of us  the one part that many of us can easily relate to  
the story revolves around a motherdaughter conteam  
and look how popular he was thirty years ago   
get my reviews of everything playing at your local cineplex so you can better make an informed decision on what to see  
the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts  
admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original  the absent minded professor   
theres a great shrink movie  
the supporting cast are all o  k  none making much of an impression  
liv tyler is pretty and humourless  as always  suspiciously  four of her fathers bands   aerosmith   songs grace the soundtrack  
they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace  played by christopher plummer   
this is mentallychallenged filmmaking  they assume the audience wont get whats going on  so they explain everything five times over  
the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency  notably with the hilarious use of the word  feminist  as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film  
i dont mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn  the movie  
one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this  
and then open fire when the kid doesnt stop running at them  
and never mind the toilet brush haircut  
its just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing  due to a strategic marketing campaign  
writerdirector daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soulsearching in this tale of seth warner  aidan quinn   a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires countrywestern lyrics  his pregnant wife drowns  his home is destroyed by a tornado  he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning  
every time i would see a bottle of the soft drink  the mission to mars logo was emblazoned upon it  
we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view  there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with largerthanlife awe  
one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief  
it is truly like you are in a video game  because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long  extended period of time  
aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso  an insult if you ask me  the performances were pretty good  
this continues for what seems like 6 hours  
the plot seemed interesting enough  after the events that took place in the original  babe the sheeppig has become a legitimate national phenomenon  
it shows joe walking to his office  
at two hours and fortyfive minutes  it all seems exorbitantly long  indulgently longwinded  
that darkly attractive aspect of her character  that shes as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord  is more or less betrayed by the final reels  in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing shes overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady whos about to take a fall  
but dont fret  it will surface again  
there is very little swearing or blood  there is a strong moral message  saccharine though it is  there is a bit of romance  whose culmination after 2 hours is a  real  kiss  no sex   
the grand finales special effects went right into the toilet at that point  
apart from the final minutes  the film is mind boggingly unscary  and the shouting matches get hideously dull  
whats worse is that body of evidence is dull  everywhere   not just in the sex scenes  
i still dont know how to react   
hopefully  this film didnt influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time  
theres some footage about a lot of other things that either dont make sense or make even less sense  
she figures out whats really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search  where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction level comet  
meanwhile  sam  convinced that hes being set up  goes to a shyster lawyer  bill murray  for help  
for parts of the middle of the film  the music stayed blissfully in the background  
he obviously had a lot of fun with this part  and it really shows  
the pace sags  the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephonetouters  
of its motley crew  it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper  a masculine potentialromanticinterest  a drunken captain  a black technician  a tatooed aborigine  a manic russian survivor  and a couple other candidates for alien food  none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin  plain piece of writing paper  
and the ending is literally a nonevent as expected  everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gales memory despite promising over the phone that they will  
silly but kind of neat too  
martin lawrence is a different story  hes so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial  
he chants  refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies  
ive attempted to obey this rule in recent months  but to do so would be impossible in this case  
  did he have no say so at all   
there are a few chuckles in the film  the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas  
its about an a student  biggs as  paul   who gets a scholarship to some college in new york city who sticks out like a sore thumb and falls for dora  suvari  a ditzy heroinchic goth chick who has no ambition or selfrespect whatsoever and allows herself to be pushed around just like  hickboy  paul is  
got it   
i  m not a prude  i just don  t think it  s warranted  
consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets  
um    
the structure of the film is annoying  repetitive and pretentious  
the talking hand was clever  and i think the inspiration for a skateboardrelated logo  
both versions of that movie were far more interesting than this flick  but ive got my job to do  so back to the salt mines we go  
for all its attempts at visual style and substance  terror train is more lionel than amtrak  more prom night than halloween  and nothing really worth watching  
maybe its unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were  
boy  what a great movie   
then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes  
theyre just stupid  
all diehard keanu reeves fans  read on

  is better than the film  
in fact  if it wasnt for brittany murphys excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen  jennifer espositos embarrassing performance as a police woman  yeah  right  
lets it lie  
it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment  
director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in varsity blues  and when in the ring  he does professional work  
when fern discovers what has happened  the fab 3 make her an offer she cant refuse  makeup  
not one single achievement  besides the conventional cinematography  is worth mentioning  
that title would be the confusing  
shes at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girlfriends  monique  wendy racquel robinson  tamala jones   
no problem  
the films plot could have been just as easily condensed  
in all fairness  weve seen many of the devices used in the generals daughter put to greater effect in other films  
will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past   terminator    terminator 2  judgement day    predator    
a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movie too  
the xfiles is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running  
this is not a cheery movie  and most of the time its downright depressing  
  
but no    
missing  too  is the sweetness that permeated american pie  the thiscouldbeyou quality of the main players  
its quite funny to see a film indulge  with the straightest of faces  in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well  and so recently  in scream  
a couple weeks ago  after seeing the trailer  a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability  
     amazing  potent stuff  
director adam rifkin knows he hasnt got much material to work with  so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning  
the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t   part three must disappoint  
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark  henry fonda in once upon a time in the west  or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city  
if you think that this ridiculous setup couldnt even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing  this might not be your cup of tea  
the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future  it has so far just ended up causing americas jails to be overcrowded with nonviolent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing americas drug usage and drug supply  
the characters were as empty as the story  and the film was an easy one to forget  
now the logic of that little subplot escapes me  
this way  you dont need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language  
the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot  a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world  do not help matters  
and more importantly  isnt there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive  
ok  that is a pretty bad title  but it fits this film perfectly  
theyre on cable tv  a couple of documentaries produced by e  and vh1  
thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians  
when steven learns of the relationship  he decides to confront david  but his approach isnt that of a typical cuckolded husband  
she still hasnt forgiven the guy as they board the terror train   you asshole  you cant have a good time without hurting somebody     
as paul atreides  the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily  but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade  
she jumps  but andy  with a bungee cord attached  goes after her  and manages to save her  at the price of a major headache   
all style and no substance  
he also starts to lose control of his case  
and talk  
every time i think those cokedup little buggers have hit rock bottom  they come up with a new excavating tool  
as it is  though   shes all that  relies  completely  on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead  
some of them arent even good  
all alone to sing a horrible rendition of  shes leaving home   accompanied by those same creepy robots  
if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be  then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film  but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i cant help but feel like he had some serious intent  
or maybe theres something deadlier around the corner  lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl  
but when elements which dont speak are going to be the best parts of your movie  youd probably better rewrite the script  
until i saw ace ventura 2  i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying  
the bumpers between scenes  which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda  just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison  
randy newman has written a playful score  
because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person  hammers character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona  
he finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king  
there is no redeeming feature in this film  not george clooney as batman  chris odonnell as robin  nor alicia silverstone as batgirl  
i have news for you  eric  no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isnt for show  unless they are four years old  
critique  three words  not enough action  
basically  we dont like these egodriven  stereotypical characters  let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements  and joe roths direction is predictable  formulaic and telegraphic  
claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze  just to break the ice  
and dennis quaid  
  
art jeffries  bruce willis  is your typical tormented fbi agent  
whats more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writerdirector victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 yearold actor in california  
anyway  some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl  john travolta  a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit  
the avengers has clearly been chopped up and reassembled so many times that even the people involved couldnt tell us what happens  
the first half hour generated not one smile in me  with its scenes of emotional abuse towards adams character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players  but also by his very disturbed mother  kathy bates  what is the world coming to    
they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells  
whether you like the beatles or not  nobody wants to see the bee gees take on some of the fab fours best known songs  
so there is a hokey ending  
the movies thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly  
but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldnt help it  
faye dunaway and peter otoole ham it up unmercifully  however when otoole overacts hes entertaining and when dunaway does it shes annoying  her character actually says the line  seize them

comments  why is this movie called possessed by the night  
there are a few of each  but theyre all token attempts

he ends up in fernwell  washington  where mopey newkidontheblock josh  kevin zegers  is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father  
problem is these action scenes  nearly all failed escapes  serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play

what did i expect from this movie  
but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d  i   but for iwo jima  guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century  
i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version  however  im only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie

anyway  willem dafoe  very good but completely wasted  also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonnas sexuality  
this film should not be called the blair witch project  it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost

these visuals work nicely  
its an evil small town story with no story to speak of  
he is let in by steve rubbell  mike myers   the infamous coowner of studio 54  because he is attractive  
still  the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond  
instead of giving the sequence a knowing winka reference to the graduate  a hint that paul is becoming an overlysensitive clichheckerling plays it deadly straight  
throughout the movie  there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage  if not of andersons  then at least of the female extras

watch the restaurant fight from the film  rush hour  and notice that the context of the fight  while technically amazing is rather flat  the framing and cut always do not help   
      perfection

influential club dj julian dice  a  k  a   lucky 7   max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro   hears her sing on a track  and decides to make her a star  
spooky

they fix on a name rita for her  but are not sure if this right or not  
theres even a subplot thats developed  it seems  only to make jokes about infidelity and incest  
how true that is when we see the  explicit  xfiles  there is nothing there  
yes  mr  walker  your script tells us that there are some screwedup folks out there  
what an auspicious beginning  
go   
its all strobe lights and glitz  all substance  
its films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects  
like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor  
in other words  its a  really dirty and b  really  really stupid  
and all we can ask is why  
the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot  
interspersed throughout all this are brief  ads  from the federal network  which present the picture of a neofascist state  much like in verhoevens robocop

maybe its just me  but if i knew i had god on my side  id have a little bit more confidence  
the hunted is such a bad movie  so completely inept and so totally braindamaged that i could almost feel affection for it  
like sidney lumets  the offence  or michael manns  manhunter    the cell  could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator

the animated  charlottes web  has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 and 1999 brought us a live action version of  stuart little   
most of the time it seems downright misogynistic  as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the womens showers or murray lifts a female m  p

when a movie is called vampires   not scary  arent words that should be associated with it  
van sants controversial  retelling  of alfred hitchcocks classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere  even before it premiered   
i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks  and that includes the actors salaries  
the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70s  but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style  i loved those fluoro coloured suits  of scorces costume drama casino  
some of you might remember the mael brothers as the 80s synth pop duo sparks  their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action  kimono my house  indeed  
if simply copying the original blues brothers wasnt bad enough  writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down  removing any memorable characters  and replacing them with flashy  but unbelievable  magical gimmicks  
it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put  they dont  
the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9  yes  precinct 9  has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony  
its based on a great book  the haunting of hill house   by shirley jackson  
this movie is the scariest movie of all time        
man  was i wrong  
there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich  and were not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place

the boy in question  a smug italian college kid named fernando  libero de rienzo  is a real piece of work  claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob  
the most rediculous scene is during mr  freezes imprisonment  
and there are about two or three amusing punch lines  the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall  and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming  this is why i left tokyo   
it seems to start out as a quirkybutrealistic action comedy  as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains  
looks  
now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have  travolta just looks like travolta  
william forsythe  for example  is painfully bad as arthur kressler  a wholesome bythebook fbi agent whos offended by becks foul language and unorthodox methods  
three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as  the killer   
the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted  cartoony atmosphere  
on the whole  it was lame  included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines  and very little of interest for any target audience  
questions like  why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark    
its sad that a writer of neil simons stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs  but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise

the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well  but it wasnt and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good  
because of that  the love letter is awkward and insincere  
the pair is able to elicit the films only laughs with their goofy antics and childlike behavior  
unfortunately  its not bad in the way great  colossal misfires like  heavens gate   1980  or  ishtar   1987  were bad  
the ex  however  though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre  differs slightly from the norm in that  at least  it doesnt take itself too seriously like so many other duds do  malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind   
in jail  things look bad for him  
the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a centerfielder from texas  
you see  there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies  also directed by donner  than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory  
the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed  
the plots a wreck with laughable dialogue  pointless pov shifts  and the one big secret solvable in the first fifteen minutes  
seen december 2  1997 at 6  50 p  m  at the glenwood movieplex cinemas  oneida  ny   theater 3  by myself for free  free pass

with the departure of kevin williamson  who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3  that  for reasons incomprehensible to me  was ignored  save the notion of  stab 3    kruger needed to be reined in tighter  and by wes craven  
even some american tourists  present in the film mostly for comic relief  seem to know better than dr  fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains  
its stone that is a disappointment among the actors  
spacey  of course  responds in his cultured monotone  that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance  
he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner  and presumably smell better  than he does  
with the second and third movie being bad  i have a feeling pokemon 4  the movie might be a total bust as well  
and arent we all sick of hearing about these army  bad boys  and their overdone  code of silence    
then he almost does the hookers roommate  
tango  cash is unbearably noisy  
ive used the phrase  angel of death  in this review very deliberately to contrast pitts performance with this years best angel performance  nicolas cages in city of angels  
aside from jared leto and joshua jackson  who arent on the screen long enough  no one in urban legend makes the grade

there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies  ranging from  raiders of the lost ark   1981  to  the goonies   1985   
the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audiences suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either characters intelligence  
that is just what never been kissed  the latest film from director raja gosnell  is  trash  
is this part of the experiment  
while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume  including two installments of  friday the 13th  and  halloween h20    screenwriter david kelley  best known as the creator of tv series like  ally mcbeal  and  chicago hope   doesnt seem to have the stomach for a chomp em up flick  
theres even a on the movies web site where you can win cellular phones  as if we havent had enough of these things already

not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in  bully  but theres also an uneasy  exploitative feel to it

the performances are topnotch and surprisingly  they are what keep the movie afloat  
while scrambling to collect himself  he frantically shouted to her   just wait a sex  er  i mean sec   
this one could have been titled the same sans one word  
the film attempts to be fresh and quirky  utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale  but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous  
other than a few nice visuals  theres nothing to recommend the picture  
following the movie i showed my wife  who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did  carpenters classic assault on precinct 13  
all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  
a disappointing film  but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals  
  zardoz  is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies  an obsession of boormans  
nbsp  so  when the xfiles made that jump from small to big screen  carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well  nbsp  
most importantly  though  the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours arent such a bore  
yikes  hows about taking it down a few notches there  fellas

ill even go so far as to say that a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well  
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply  
pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers  and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments  
i desperately needed something to cheer me up  or at least distract me so i could get a clear head  
the movie is completely schizophrenic in its tone and texture  
bobby as terminator  
this  too  did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for  
this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face  
his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards  but  since there must be a movie  luck is with him  
fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever  
it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content  
plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too wellknown for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly  
thats what makes this movie stay on your mind  
but  to paraphrase the bard  swill  by any other name  would smell as rank  
sure  that makes sense  
too bad the executions all wrong  though  because the setup of  desperate measures  boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use

the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences  huh     the idioplot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax  but everyone believes that hes going to kill himself  hardyharhar  and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ballsniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie  well    i 
a friendship develops between the two men  but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate  
vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico  
barb wire was adapted from a comic book  interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life  even wearing lowcut leather to do office work  businesswoman bondage wear  and having unreal body proportions  
but you realize all too quickly that tuckers overstated liveliness is the only thing  money talks  has going for it

this is a liveaction road runner cartoon  moving so quickly that its over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions  
i also hate ryan phillippe  so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be  
unfortunately  its also shapeless  pointless and largely unfunny

because shes pregnant  
okay  maybe anaconda is actually a decoy  and theres really a better movie waiting to make its debut  
only in the movies  
between the frantic dancing  woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact  
and reitman  who has made some good films  at least tries to make things exciting   
as a comedy  all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat

in bride of chucky  chuckys longtime girlfriend tiffany  jennifer tilly  dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo  
immediately the films biggest flaw is apparent  are these people primitive or highly advanced  
meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable  but everything about dr  casper is recycled beyond recognition  
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss  
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while  with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and whitebread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely toopleasant smile on his face  
the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland  where gaerity  tommy lee jones   ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material  escapes from prison  
theres also an interesting subplot revolving around dannys father  brian cox   but it doesnt have much to do with the main story

appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin  james brown  eric clapton  and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film  but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors

eves biorhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk  mates   which we are forced to witness in grossout detail  but otherwise there doesnt appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film  unless it was written into her contract  lets hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only   
when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant  there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else  
while a decent joke slips through the cracks here and thereduring a  dance bootcamp  scene  the girls sing the lyric  we know how we got this farstrength and courage and a wonderbra  much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level

harry block  allen  has in his life only two drives  
the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason  and thats what moves the plot

jakob the liar is a confused  muddled little movie  a generically  uplifting  film with a fundamental contradiction  the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesnt realize it  
the movie lacks danger  
i just wish he hadnt brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toestub  
bah  
but of course tom is more than willing to save the day  so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town  
however  i rather liked that about the series  nbsp  
as a romance  it is at best a minor pleasure  
and despite some gruesome violence  he barely manages a single scare in the entire film  
the films main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell  
  terrible   
the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture  
permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback  with recovering addict bello meeting stiller  at a fastfood restaurant  where stiller works the drivethru as part of rehab   taking him back to a hotel  and between bouts of serious screwing  listening to his life story  
i think its important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isnt a  real epic  by any stretch of the imagination  
movie seems to have a dogindanger sequence  volcano  dantes peak  independence day  daylight  twister  
no  this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues  and the writer of the film  charlie peters  didnt include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad  
it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film

the film starts off entertaining enough  but throughout this very long movie  it just gets sillier and sillier

but  if they dont  then thats fine  
sam neils caricature of a slightly stout  effeminate and softspoken gentlemanatlarge nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as  an insolent spectre on leave from hades  endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror   
a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience  
its too bad the camera didnt linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts  
she could have been a tourdeforce  but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role  
at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship  but eventually they let down their guard and become closer  
this one is more or less neither

awful decision there joel  
he starred in februarys  the pest   a movie that i still think is the years worst so far  although this one does give it a run for its money  
it opens with a fun  innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that  
gere is trying to stop him  
perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechlesss politics  
my recommendation  duck in while youre waiting for another movie to start  
the list of movies from which charlies angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing

ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple  david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at  coming back   who are playing sex games  
perhaps if one character were foul mouthed  but in this film  everybody swears nearly every other word  
he lends the film a much needed exciting  comic bookish look  
in the end  this film reminds us that original approach cant prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities  
in fact  based on the popularity of scott adams cartoon  dilbert   which will soon have its own television series  a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood  
trouble is  hes chosen a lurid  often jokey tone for the balance of the picture  including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes  and its impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is  to a great extent  nothing more than a puton

none of the actors in the winner are in top form here  and this film wont likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes  
sonic weapons  
of course  verhoevens probably the one to blame  and perhaps im jealous because im so disgusting  
its like riding a bike  
episode 1 is just disappointing  
anyway  the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy  or a higher power will blow up the earth  
paulina runs 1  28  
look  if you have jackie chan playing a chef  why not use that to your advantage  
and her ability to whine and irritate us  even while nude  was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone  
then again  i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device  with the little mermaid  both the disney version and the original folktale  being among them  that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold  
in fact  the script is embarrsingly weak  and the characterizations not much better  sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come  with the script not bothering to develop them

in many respects  isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential  like a rocky horror for the new millennium

mary  a makeup artist  regularly works on model sahara  bridgette wilson   who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disneys the little mermaid  
hes the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may  
i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time  
in fact  con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement  too many characters  too much editing  too many dopey punch lines  too much of the cheap  ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts  
then youve seen  supernova   
why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me  
the coverup attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends  two wives and several innocent bystanders  
basically  we follow the trials and tribulations of two wouldbe couples  one young  the other older  
this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governors  harvey korman  attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad  
everything else fails

awwww  
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously cant call the authorities for help  
i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film  the violence  the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge  head submerged underwater  
only a few loyal swashbuckers remain  among them athos and portos  who are only figureheads in this movie   
mortensen is a little bit better  coming across as a younger douglas  but his role isnt meaty enough to show all his talent  
  yeah  you and every 14yearold boy in america   
the idea at the films core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds  
in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition  directors cut  of the film on home video  a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres

in the past year and a half weve seen them in life is beautiful  youve got mail  this movie  and the upcoming notting hill   who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore  
however  instead of sticking with this  perhaps even going a bit further with it  they let this lie  and actually make these characters into our heroes  
to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves  
i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films  
1949s  mighty joe young  was an update of that classic creature feature  also based on merian c  coopers original story  16 years after  kong  it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable

after each murder  abraham would become stronger  until his power surpassed that of amblyns  
this is like antigravity  
heres what i think  harlem nights is charmless  unoriginal  disappointing  and almost without question  the worst film of the actors career  i havent seen best defense   
its almost a guarantee  
this is a sad review to write  because babe 2 not only does not live up to the original  but it doesnt even come to a fraction of it  
they all have this same formula  they all have the same action  same villain  same plot  but this one has that message  which makes it more excrucitating to watch  
edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame  
in a  seinfeld  episode  this technique proved funny  here  it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably

the killing starts before the train even leaves the station  
thankfully  as soon as it makes its money  it will never be seen again  and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie  down the toilet  
these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet wont kill off the entire human race  
in his early years of filmmaking he mastered the simple comedy

indeed  the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid  
when the other children  chuckie  and twins lil and phil  suggest taking dill back to the hospital  tommy goes along with it  but on their way there  they crash in the forest  and become lost  running into wolves and circus monkeys  among other things  
dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face  he is one part darth vader  one part emperor and two parts grim reaper  
the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible  coincidences  that i would describe as contrivances if it werent for the film ohsocleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around  serendipity   
plot  a downandout girl moves in with some overthetop models and falls in love with a goofybutloveable guy from across the street  
he makes the actors as sweaty and dirty as possible  makes them snort cocaine  gives them guns and condoms  and lets them go  
it consists of countless stories  but not a definable plot  
speechless is a limp  poorly structured wouldbe romantic comedy  
sure  it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there  but on the whole  it took waaaaay too long to get going  provided very little meat in the plot  went way past its own bedtime  and basically relied on grunts  the muttering of childrens voices and overthetop special effects  to scare us  
you be the judge   
he  and the slugs inside him  promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more coeds into slug zombies  
watching the film  which was made in 1987  i couldnt help but take notice that the killers costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in   scream   and  scream 2   
its easy cash to capitalize off the first films success  but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original  
it is a drama  
neither super nor standard   8mm  is shocking only in its banality  
12 year old trevor  haley joel osmet   a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother  helen hunt   comes up with the notion to pay it forward  this entails a person doing one good deed  call it an uber favor  for three others  then telling them to do the same for three others and before long were all living in a frank capra movie  
but mediocre is better than dreadful  which this film is  thanks in no small part to the hodges contextual frame for the romance  
instead of having the criminal  napolean  wilson  this film has the criminal  desolation  williams  
this film practically swept the  razzie awards  in 1999  given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year  with no less than the  worst picture  award  the  worst screenplay   joe eszterhas   the  worst supporting actor   joe eszterhas   the  worst new star   joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer  and the  worst original song    i wanna be mike ovitz   
it consists of multiple copies and direct rippoffs from several great science fiction films and stories  
nobody gives a good performance in this film  
even  volcano  ended nicely  and that movie really sucked  
working from a best selling novel by nicholas sparks  which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county   di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times

you cant really blame van damme  
phil  radmar jao  has a hairy problem  
these are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience  
what a mess  
the acting is just as bad  but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light  
i was not alone  
chronicling the meaningless lives of vain  yuppie types  the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films  last days of disco  barcelona and metropolitan  but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing

im no dan quayle  but i thought it was a bit creepy  
gonna tell it the way i remember it   
so you cant call it a sex flick  
once the case is solved  the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue  
every time something clever happens its counterbalanced by something so overtly wrong that it jerks you back into realizing youre watching a movie  
theater rating     12  very good sound  picture  and seats 
and  with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tieins before it even opens  its virtually guaranteed at least 100 million  
in most of the scenes  the snake is computer generated  and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real  
unfortunately  despite the best efforts of firsttime director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costners work in the postman look stark  jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy  
gabriel byrnes  who ironically played a priest in  stigmata   here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character  
hes cool and dashing  which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut  which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film   and blustered his way through magnolia  quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90s   
nbsp  the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people  nbsp  
there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do dont make sense  
these vampires do not maintain a low profile  
for  indeed  john carpenter has run out of things to say  and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story  
rebecca gayheart  following roles in  scream 2  and  urban legend   should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie  
about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass  officers   
last year  the benevolent studio gods gave us digimon  and this year  they bestow max keebles big move on delighted moviegoers across the country  
somehow  even though her car is parked at the front of the house  right by the front door  daryl is oblivious to her presence inside  
theyre a typical aaron spelling couple  goodlooking but as vacant as george w  bushs republican national convention speech  i  e  
implausible material  no less  
thats about all thats understandable in the film  as after we learn this much  issac  john franklin  who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter  now an older  strange man  is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy  
but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better  
it is this cast which lifts this hohum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror  
it smashed u  s box office office records in its opening weekend and will no doubt do the same here  
because there would be no movie  thats why  
it isnt  
i wont detail the story any further  this seems enough to illustrate my point  
with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit  batman  robin    a time to kill    batman forever    the client  schumacher certainly has that kind of influence  
but by the time these interesting changes occur  its far too late in the film for them to have much affect  
when the u  s  marshals come to arrest him  it turns out that kahl isnt alone  
the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism  but at that point it didnt matter much what happened  
everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap  from the roger cormangrade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign  the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi  the undiscovered country   
leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits  all intended to show us that for a hired killer  hes really not so bad a guy  he drinks lots of milk  takes meticulous care of a potted plant  and enjoys gene kelly movies  
he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up  without her knowledge  their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage  
where are the stories about womens world  
theyre these octopus men  boring freaking octopus men  
i would willingly rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through this miserable collection of filmic momentsprologues  epilogues  etc  the premise  a lawyer cant lie for a day  
for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film  
there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy  
speaking of script  hank nelkans choppy script is not only badly written  but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street  
the biggest lesson to be learned from  batman and robin  is that more is not better  
the chosen woman is christine york  robin   
period  
murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines  and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply  
  soldier   by director paul anderson  is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting  
just think  if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost  and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff  
its not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with  
but to add to the excitement  as i mentioned earlier  there are endless car chase scenes  
as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon  all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes  
singer lopez seems to think shes in a video as well  she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting  
joe eszterhas has written the screenplay  and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge  the killers identity is kept a secret until the movies final shot  
almost heroes almost works  but misses the wagontrain by quite a longshot  
this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time  but it ends up failing on both fronts  
march may be attractive  but  at least judging by this performance  she cant act  
the first hour of the film  though  was actually quite engaging  
and not a particularly good one at that  
when you consider that the other  part  of this film is geared as an actionadventure  i would say that this another negative sign  
he doesnt do it kleboldharris style  
yawn  
cinematographers mark gilfedder  peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city  which is akin to turning london into san paolo  
  
thats about as much of a plot as we have  
know the drill  
his sets are obsessively detailed  and even before the cgi kicks in  they seem alive  never quite still  
its not so clever this time  consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal exgovernment employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street  
the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish  
thatll do   
unfortunately  when it comes time to have those people walk and talk  he hasnt the faintest notion of what to do  
kramer   and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment  
i know he didnt intend to  but de bont has done one thing right  hes created the handsdown funniest film of the year  
i wont fault barry sonnenfeld either  
offered as counterpointor perhaps reliefto these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers  fantasies in which the woman lipsynchs to pop songs by grace chan  popular  so im told  in 1950s china

  me  myself  irene  reeks of wasted opportunities  
and then theres the inevitable  heartless meanie  character  in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulders mentor  
  street fighter   
nobody acts like this  
like home alone 3 but without any class  mr  
the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition  
  ghostbusters  had three really funny guys as its scientists  bill murray  dan aykroyd  and harold ramis   but  evolution  has one really funny guy  orlando jones  who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone elses hands  
it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning  
however  eighteen years have passed  and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged  
why do batman  robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency  
they havent spoken in years  and wouldnt even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen  scotland by automobile if it werent for kaisas mother  charlotte rampling  under the sand  rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer  
the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy  kim basinger  being arrested in the middle of a job  
liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear  
but not the script  
why is spawn so bad  
way of the gun is brimming with surprises  some good  most bad  
a totally dull story that thinks it can use various explosions to make it interesting   the specialist  is about as exciting as an episode of  dragnet   and about as well acted  
much  much more  
he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole  
hey  i never said she wasnt a hot number    
the movie is otherwise technically impressive  with a solid cinematography and fine lighting  
what a contrast  
for that matter  they were almost nonexistent  
and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight  
in all honesty  elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour  
even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department  she nonetheless is very good  and the two scenes that work  flashbacks to christmas 1988  when she had a heartbreaking runin with her mother  and to halloween 1993  when lou crashed her sons birthday party in a drunken stupor  are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations  
but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse  
alex proyass new movie screams atmosphere  
as campbell  wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partners eccentric habits  but the chemistry between the two is minimal  and seagals wooden comebacks make for painful watching  
i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt  
kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson  whose screenplay the messenger  the story of joan of arc  for all of that films flaws  was at least thoughtful  
however  it cant hold up  
yet  i must report disappointment  
  for now anyway

though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years  waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can  read  early january  when everyones still trying to catch up on the potential oscarnominees   it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film  its laden with complex machinery  boasts respectable production design  and it may even feature believable special effects    if  of course  i  or anyone else  could see them  
he has to contend with  among other things  a redhot science teacher  amber valletta  family man   a pair of polaropposite bullies  noel fisher and orlando brown   and an illiterate principal  larry miller  the princess diaries  whos secretly diverting the schools last dime into the football program

as a huge fan of the 80s animated tv show  the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain  
on the way there  he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things  like burning native villages  to earn the wrath of the locals  
right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama  
its all part of some type of ransom scheme  but all i remember isand i kid you notgraphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world  bombs detonating  and an hatwearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter

the performances are hardly worth talking about  
sing a happy song  
ill leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie  
and its not how terribly contrived the plot is  its the way its broken down scenebyscene  with absolutely no transition  
though  more appropriately perhaps  itd be better to say that its the better of two turkeys  
scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity  minutes after finding the dead young woman  brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue  which includes endless strings of forced lines  
ironically  to fully appreciate the best scene  that of cole and malcolm attending a little girls funeral   the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy  
if i havent got my point across  ill say it more plainly  this is a bad movie  
such scenes as dancing flubber  a flying car  a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber  and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze  delight  or even cause people to laugh  
skip this one altogether and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead    trust 
including  and i must admit this is a very nice touch  visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital  
and there are some nice touches

suddenly  after hearing about the families heartbreak and personal stories  he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery  even though he is warned by his staff accountant  william h  macy  that no money is coming in to them  only going out  
and what about that script  
i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one  only because his character gets the worst lines   sex without love equals violence    
such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors  but it leaves audiences with a booby prize  
this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film  
sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices  
he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star  shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting

the action in the film is neither jackies best nor worst  but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes

president grant sends west and gordon to investigate  
after an overdone special effects thing  theyre    inside a goddam pyramid  
burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn  
another character  played by jay mohr  has a problem with his sexual triumphs  
this is the biggest problem  the movie isnt about jacksons character  or his dilemma  or this case  or any of its  frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction  characters  
he works better with the camera this time around  especially in the early scenes  
while everything is pretty lifeless  teaching mrs  tingle remains watchable  
more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester  and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character  he hams it up well  
that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all  
while darrell puts a new hose on the ride  bobby walks into town to see whats cooking

this is an unworthy sequel to a grossfest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy

all well and good  right  
maybe the film would have been better if  instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks  it were set entirely during joshuas last year with his grandpa  
and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean  
naaaaaaah  
ive seen his name around recently  he was one of the toucheruppers on the armageddon script   and i imagine that  for the most part  he knows what hes doing when it comes to screenwriting  
at one point  a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother  
oscarwinner huttons manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on  
a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this  but its never actually explained  
rather complex  in fact more than it needs to be   monkey bone  had potential in the script and even the story  
but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself  
  the black ooze   and extraterrestrial  viruslike substance is threatening earth  
the movie forgoes that aspect of his character  and hammer comes off not only as amoral in societys terms  but in any terms  especially his own  
which is ironic  since children are  probably  carreys best audience

that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are  each one more annoying than the other  culminating in the most obnoxious one of all  that brazilian lover  jose   who is about as charming as a snakeoil salesman  who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil  was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story

i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs  
the laughs arent as pronounced this time around  the energy level  the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here

mr  anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue  a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble  and a heavy handed segment of  historical  occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing

i dont think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun  satirical look at a group that got so big  a movie seemed the next likely step  
while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  
critique  if youre not a fan of movies packed with plot holes  inconsistencies and yes  even more plot holes  heed my words and skip this hollow thriller

well here is where the plot thickens  lol   the two wish to rescue the king  and put him back into the wcw but not that easily  because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them  while davids father wants him to become a police officer  and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots  
what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony  a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution

i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster  or see only brief glimpses  mere suggestions of what the monster is  it is not because i find the monster so terrifying  but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying

oh  of course  she appears naked from the waist up  and  of course  segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship  they did not even seem to be interested in each other  
in all honesty  the best part of this film is the end credits  
i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches  an isolated location  a storm  parentless teenagers  false alarm nightmares  lots of bluelighted darkness scenes  a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him  knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere  etc  you get the picture

the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery

the performances are generally better than in the doom generation  which isnt saying much  
yahoo has created a charming family for albert  and the scenes on tasmania are often clever

from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad  and well i guess i was right  
ive loved all his films  until this one  
im sure there are better ones around  
i already had the female character picked out  the girl who was sitting next to him in the back of the room during the electrocution scene   but i guess ill never know for sure what happened

thats not a good sign  
but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay

even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaimans sickening musical score  
one of the most glaring problems with long  who made his acting debut in john woos broken arrow  is that hes so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery  
every other scene  we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture  
for those first 40 minutes  he manages to make a tired premise interesting  adding in aspects of unique flavor into a ripoff story  and thats something that not too many writers can do  
but as cockamamie as the science is in the film  it isnt quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics

except for the choreographed action sequences  the film was dull for threequarters of its time  filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed  
he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france  
in order to give the film some emotional heft  there are several subplots designed to tug at our heartstrings or give us the thrill of    yawn  excuse me  dramatic tension

my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end  
this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes  
as a commentary on race relations  its even  less  effective  
horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly  and a nightmare on elm street just doesnt cut it

tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city  
just beats bobby silly  
therefore  if another tarzan movie is to be made  one might assume that it would have something new to offer  a different angle  an original storyline  anything to set it apart from all the others  
thats the only thing that honestly caught my interest  
bottom line  how they all kept straight faces  ill never know  
and even his sidekick costar   saturday night live  alumnus rob  makin copies  schneider  does whats expected of him  although neither appear to want the role of straight man

the publisher is proud that hes a mammas boy who never married and is a selfmade man who has earned millions  
but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid  intrusive score by ennio morricone  
the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior  a fish called wanda   
as for nicholson  well  even the devil needs a direction to go in  and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie  due to the grace of the screenwriter and  more importantly  nicholsons acting   he still cant be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague

wong  who directed such films as  rocknroll cop  back in hong kong  is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy  
nothing could be further from the truth  
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goingson  
there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out  its the kind of stuff ive seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny

it features a moses who  in the interests of making the character more human  lacks any divinity whatsoever  which isnt convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is  
  and whats with the dreary lighting   
really  i dont

this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard  you were always the better brother etc  etc  etc    and doesnt help to add anything to the film  
the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city  
the title is  of course  a contradiction  
almost  but not quite  
even though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong  kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two  simply because his jerkish actions are calculated  
still  the two veteran actors are fun to watch  
unfortunately  this film still belongs to action movie genre  and there is too much violence for little children  
this appears to be a high profile and wellpaid job  
had the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake  rather than the dry one that equates to be  
although some of the films smaller roles are filled with some actors that  while not big stars  are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows  
any of these points however are completely  erased  from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script

although kevins career is taking off  his home life is not doing very well  
critique  with plot holes the size of my ass  this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich  ridden plot  with wasted talent  cheezy effects  bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot  
the adults also dont fare well  
instead  the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people andor cars rolling downhill in the forest  and with constant annoying references to other disney films  
barrymore  on the other hand  is simply charming as julia  
when there werent random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect  which wasnt that good either  trust me  and the scare  the film was filled with drab  laughable dialogue  
a tad bewildered  but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films  i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind  having great expectations for the film  
nevermind   
anyway  hubbys daughter  who  if course  is not  wifes  daughter  starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams

however  while the devils advocate strives to get noticed  ultimately it makes very little impression at all  
the movie  
at least there you dont have to pay to see her cleavage

soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri  but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains  
everything seemed possible  
but its clear how weak this premise is from the getgo and the film just gets worse  
the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in whats going on so that these flaws in logic dont become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled

you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made      
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded  you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are  no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat  and no idea how long the ride will last  
that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves  
the script is simply a silly and unresolved story  which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture  
and despite all the cuts  several cast members still make a strong impression  most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen  
i actually gave this one a high rating  if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins  i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction  but nothing else  
it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay  
however  by confusing the viewer with a ton of addins and parodies  the movie ends up being something that just doesnt work  
the morality of the film seems to be  if you can get away with it  go for it

fire joel schumacher  but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishists convention so hell understand that theres no hard feelings

the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary  
renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jeanclaude van damme on the action stars 1997 pairing with dennis rodman  doubleteam  and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick  stylish  and somewhat diverting action timekiller

however  once they catch harriett and put her in jail  and sir roger daley takes complete charge  it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin  
at times  the events border on the ridiculous  like the screening of the film  but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives  
kate is at first repulsed by the idea  but after getting immediate positive results  she pursues it  
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that ive never seen dreyfuss perform  and he does a great job  
this all happens in the opening shot  and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction  
vegas vacation comes off like the first

at some points  they use the cliche of the talking villain  where the villain has the advantage  can shoot seagal  but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan  or saying a corny line  to which seagal says something hokey back  and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them  and does

comments  thanksgiving  
production values are shoddy  
the film follows hannah  natalie ramsey  a teen looking for her mother in gatlin  nebraska  on the eve of her 21st birthday  
none of these fantasy sequences  trust me  are things that need to be seen  but we see them anyway  complete with cheesy  makeout saxophone music  
her character  though  is hugely underwritten  one of the most wasted characters of the year  
he leaves jane  his first mistake  in my opinion  and travels to africa  
a student  the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan  denise richards   has a crush on him  
while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona  1987   ever since leaving las vegas  1995   cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot  such as in the terrible snake eyes  1998   
some of the low points are when the thief steals a womans purse  and then she faints  sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom the thief kills to the music of psycho

suffice to say  the comedy in  the whole nine yards  works about as well as the brokendown lawnmower in my backyard  and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes  it is by sheer luck

when the comet does hit the earth  you almost wish it could just take this film along with it  
because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii  saving private ryan can only pan for small truths in the shallows

director luis mandokis last film was the superb  serious 1994 drama  when a man loves a woman   but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture   message in a bottle   which is the worst type of romance  a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up  
his character in  metro  takes himself seriously  
not alcohol and drugs  good  
the concept is  leviathan  meets  titanic   with a dash of  speed 2  thrown in for good  or is that bad

take away the title and the jedi talk and the force  and youre left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time  
in fact  the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot

there isnt a single conflict that takes center stage  except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works  
i cant think of a more appropriate connection  this movie is a stupid pet trick  
nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep  and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo  
as for the actual  earthquake   its rather a letdown  
oh  and jam  real name jeremiah  has a really  really annoying ultrareligious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency  
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls  who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery

hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11thhour reshoots  wrapped only a month ago   a rash of studioimposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew  especially christopher  unhappy  and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics  
also  the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture  
every forty minutes of this twohour film begins with a new theme  virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act  
this  of course  will be of no service to your readers  but at least youll avoid the hate mail from the movies fans  
what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes  
then again  i dont want it to seem like im complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable  since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway  not the story  
he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians  the ones he used when courting her  when he serenaded her under her window  
thats about all i saw before the big fight began and  let me tell you  that was twice as interesting as the movie itself  
i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is  into it  even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding  
claire danes  giovanni ribisi  and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists  but theyre just about the only palatable element of the mod squad  a lamebrained bigscreen version of the 70s tv show  
i suppose theres some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise  if they were that desperate  
the way    
andrew kevin walkers screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story  the legend of sleepy hollow   
his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar  and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does  
matthew modine plays joe  a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent  
but their newfound popularity does not impress their father  who has other plans for them  
several years ago dr  norman goodman  played by dustin hoffman  was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered  
an attempt to satirize stupid television  we get a selfparody instead  
while the characters flail at each other  oneliners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti  
the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect  but just try lasting the first threequarters  
a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played  
murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better  
if he had played the character straight  along the lines of leslie nielson in the  naked gun  series  he probably would have been a lot more successful  
while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer  the end result is no net gain  
  be gentle   urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in  the whole nine yards   
sadly  i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been  
gheorghe muresan isnt a natural actor at all  and his thick cottonmouthed accent certainly doesnt help  
you couldnt tell it from the audience though  a braintree  mass  of growing  glowing prepubescent girls  and the odd parental  popcorn perched about their persons   who positively cheered when the end credits rolled  ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddyduddy old me   
the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust  
but even that wasnt enough for the filmmakers apparently  as they later have to infer that ironsides character is gay  
schwarzenegger is a persona  not an actor  so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea  
he has played the character of  seth  on tvs  malibu shores  several times  
surprise  it just takes waaaaay too long  
the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch  
the movie offers only two explanations  neither of which make a lick of sense  
at that point it hit me  i didnt care for any of the characters being played by actors i didnt really like  
and he takes them there  holding up a baby doll and yelling   if humans couldnt speak  then how do you account for this talking doll    
unfortunately  the current trend is to  overscore   
as their motives become murky and unclear  the film finally falls to the point that it doesnt really matter who wins or loses  since all sides have become equally detestable  
anyway  johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark  
also worthy of note are lindy hemmings costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely  
in fact  i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic  
shane  in this incarnation  is sanitized to the point of blandness  an idealistic dogooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club  julie black  campbell   a worldly soap star with  yes  a heart of gold  
is the culprit the original urban legends murderer  just some random psycho   
this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash  
alicia plays  well  the babysitter  who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents  j  t  
contact  for example  far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination  
the most prominent example  however  may be the fact that when the film starts  there are no opening credits  
i wish id seen it when it was halloween  
like some sort of holy ateam  they even have their own soupedup van   the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack  
im not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film  except just to say its terrible  
the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdans trite but occasionally useful grand canyon  where steve martins hollywood mogul pronounces   all of lifes riddles are answered in the movies   
in my opinion  he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in camerons  terminator   
and these  unfortunately  run hot and cold  
if only kevin smith could write them all    
but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead  
then  right around the onehour mark  thats the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatevers left of titanic   the virtually nonstop action begins  and  once it starts  the script becomes superfluous  
if theres anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world  it is our ability to tell a good story  
gee  what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time  
something that he has not yet successfully achieved  
congratuations go out to annette bening  winner of this weeks  title   
they use giants spheres the roll around underground  supposedly at thousands of miles per hour    oh 
hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film  schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue  and lee  poor lee  is miscast  
surprisingly  at least considering her work in me  myself and irene  renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance  building on her baby faced  apple pie looks  
set in 1692 at salem  massachusetts  the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon  
not surprisingly  the most energetic performance is given by samuel l  jackson  but his harry isnt a person  hes a walking plot device spouting occasionallywitty dialogue  
but once i saw that  i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot  
this is a laughable 1977 rip off of king kong  1976   itself a ripoff  
from that moment on  its all downhill  
give that man an award or something  
both the production design  anthony masters  and costume design  bob ringwood  are striking and original  
meg ryan  diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who  once separated by career judgments over family ties  must reunite when their father  walter matthau  is admitted into the hospital with alzheimers disease  
they should know the ending as well as we do  
as the story goes  there is an ancient myth explaining that babies  ages 2 and under  know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences  
predictably  the man who knows nothing will fight against the odds and give the company its most profitable and successful turnaround ever  all because he ran things by common sense and not greed  
instead  it just turns out to be merely average  
mcdonalds charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role  yes  pogue makes it a hattrick   
also on the topic of flaws  the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly  why  
  almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen  and i found myself laughing pretty hard   
and by golly  just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead  
the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods  
i think thats a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent  not to mention a significant number of iq points  
shes utterly charming  and has excellent experience  harriet the spy  for the part of the pintsize detective  
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing  the way of the gun  that at first glance looks like another of those wannabes but upon closer inspection doesnt look like anything comprehendable  
well  its a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun   
the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize its main characters  and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion  
i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks  
the director yells   will smith  do your own thing    and 
that sure is revealing information  
the movie  
of course  in the case of a perfect murder  at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless  cardboard characters  
this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene  
david arquette  scream  takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic  and not have his brilliant acting ruined  
the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands  form a chorus line  and break into a rendition of  springtime for hitler   
he steals the package with the antidote  peels off a latex mask  which is a replica of the hero of the story  ethan hunt  cruise   who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust  
is it about the business itself  how  bubbling just beneath the surface of bigtown americana  theres a sordid world of sick and depraved people who wont necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires  
marc blucas appears in  jay and silent bob strike back  as fred from the scooby doo gang  while freddie prinze jr  plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon  
i mean  its like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining  well  the same goes here  
to do this  they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting  
if he did  id give this a good 3 stars  
l  williams illinois gordon           chi 
and you can not do that without studying  
it seems that audiences tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt  
but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me  
i wont lie  this is definitely a guilty pleasure  
theres not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good  
mayor ebert is not pleased  
when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them  they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma  
to simply say that this is the worlds largest snake wouldnt be doing it justice  since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide  
if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack  this film mightve had a chance to be more than what it is now  
a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies  and bats sure could use some  
as a result   get carter  amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller  bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement  
4  there are two many interfering  irrelevant side stories  
this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after  battlefield earth  begins  
and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing  
it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets  but goes no further  
the movie fails to explain how these two hooked up  
lame  unoriginal screenplay  
and surprise  they get fired  
opinion  its a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk  and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior  
pretty much like last years  meet joe black   this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesnt deserve  
sure  why not  
his closest friends dont help matters  bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party  
weve seen the traditional action flick opener  the clever hostage negotiation scene  
the actors in that movie were having fun and  from that  the audience had fun  
if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending  perhaps there could have been some freshness to it  
a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film  
most entries into this wornout  wormeaten genre arent especially good  
i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy  
but none of this movies saving graces can it make it something id recommend seeing  no matter what the price of admission  
the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle  inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf  
this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema  
best remembered for his understated performance as dr  hannibal lecter in michael manns forensics thriller  manhunter  scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on  
the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie ive ever seen  my  um  favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship  during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves  rain  and any other oceanextremeties the film can cook up  then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned  well  i must say  thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldnt figure it out when i saw it   
through its whole duration  i did not learn one thingnot one thingabout travoltas lawyer character  jan schlictmann  who doesnt appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job  
a road movie  a teen comedy  a mob thriller  a drama about family relationships  you name the cliche and  excess baggage  likely covers its territory  
so she calls sly  leaves messages with him  sends him email  etc  about planting a bomb to kill roberts  which sly listens to obsessively  and while he works out naked  
he seems held back and really doesnt get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old  
well  lets just say that if he didnt  i would give this film a grade of  d   
the critical difference between the rock and con air is cages performance  
its a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey  
sputtering like a twoday old campfire  the story plays like an adlib sketch that was never polished or completed  
because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy  
helgelands film  which was recut by mel the producer  is devoid of an imperative dime store charm  
thanks for being there so i had something to look at  but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole  for making them all out to be complete imbeciles   
theres wit in here somewhere  im told  
the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each others face

i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning  nightmarish future world where its always a late night in 1948  complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras  
heres how much of a disaster this is   battlefield earth  is already the worst movie of the year  and its going to take something really  really inept to top it  
still  there are few nicely tense moments  maybe the only in the movie  during the timeframe involving a fuel leak

anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film  
the movie must be authentic  
smith seems to be having a better time as west  although hes not nearly as charming as he was in mib  
fleischers direction is clumsy  especially during the fight scenes  and all the actors give weak performances  especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable  
so much is overdone in  stigmata   that it eventually has no effect on the audience  leaving us to pick out the films  many  flaws  
unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too  
here  its just  hey  lets chase these people around with some robots   
donahue  williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth  
the movies scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice  
however  as we all know  its not sets or effects that make a movie  its the characters  and quite frankly  these characters are no good  
it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin  you just cant trust these homicide detectives   someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them  and hence  well  you know  that  glimmer man  thing  
if it werent for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980  
during the dimension jump  i think thats what its called  but dont hold me to it   the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal  peter facinelli  is brought on board  
soon they have company in the person of serafine  julie delpy   who has decided to end it all  
the characters are mere devices for the  nasty  twists  
but thats not necessary since were implicitly informed of his innocence  
an example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene  in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood  the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant  
director tim burtons unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly  pointless remake  
however  this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted  
the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudolegendary ed wood  the man behind such  classics  as plan 9 from outer space and night of the ghouls  
there was one scene that should have been short    
screenwriter steven e  de souza provides another conflict  this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and businesslike professionalism of the bad guys

the teams somewhat mentally disturbed coach  henry winkler  realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pentup rage  which  if harnessed properly  would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field  
even with the huge cast talent  the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours  
most of the socalled adventures are cheesy  predictable  and unexciting  with no pace  tension  or action to speak of  
in fact  the movie begins with not one but two car chases  
the original film  released last summer  was genuinely scary and terrifying  i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor  
youre better off leaving this guy alone  
this film couldve been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy  but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary  and bad at that   
if it came down to a fight for leadership between you and the leader of the terrorists  why didnt you do that halfway through the film and save us all a lot of headaches  
men are liars  inherently empty creatures  but if you hang around long enough    
van sant has made a boring film  
this movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office   
1  its worse than shes all that  
obviously successful films need both skills

in  batman forever   burt ward wanted to be batmans partner and friend  
the plot turns in several places are contrived  
ironically  this one could be considered the best for a bad reason  it best represents what quentin has done with this film  
and you could just smell the disaster brewing  
the plot is bascially smith  playing a lawyer  getting into hot water with some high government murderers  who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in the movie  when a tape of the killing gets into his hands  
the 1964 film stars peter sellers  in three roles   george c  scott  sterling hayden  and slim pickens

there is no story  script  point or acting  
cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile  as he tries to carry off this macho role  while thandie is not an actionfilm girl  and seems like a fish outofwater in this one  
hes not a warrior  and at first not well accepted by the vikings  but as the movie advances hell have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield  
it kept taking my attention from the film  not altogether a bad thing  ill grant you  as what was transpiring onscreen wasnt that riveting  
that  plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer  should be enough to lure us into the theatre  
and when the final moments do come  its a huge letdown  the end makes no sense at all  
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after  christine york  robin tunney   
the days of breathless are no more  
his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems  
its a nice special effect  though  
pull the string   
the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind  the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe  and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe  
this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure  
one where the dinos lived untouched by mankind and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened  
you never know  they just might be on to something  
well sure thats scary in real life  but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting  
weve always had movies of this nature  on the beach  the end of the world  damnation alley  the ultimate warrior  and so on  
the bottom line  however  is this  virus is a bad movie  
that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten  
van damme is true to laughable form  perhaps even worse than usual  
with all the cliches  it is only fitting the films climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film  that of someone outrunning a fireball  
its a bad plan  
even with its 100m budget  end of days  is less than pleasing  
there are many scenes such as this in the generals daughter  in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure  but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb  
plus  to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actors talents  
he eventually begins to suspect that his boss  cardinal houseman  jonathan pryce   is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church  
but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense  and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train  
the pacing in both films is languidhow is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development  
however  catharines character is hardly developed at all  and lopez has no depth to offer the role  
two days isnt a bad movie but there isnt much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters  
mimic  then  may fail with its story  pacing and characters  but the film does look good  
the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity  
unfortunately  there is nothing that could help this film  
the acting is just plain awful  
next time they should  spy  a little bit harder  
verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground  but if its adult entertainment you want  stay home and watch the playboy channel  
its so uniquely bad  a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries  and miserably fails  to be serious  that its oddly fascinating

not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero  he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos language and technology  
to counter that  ciscos partner has a trace buster buster buster  
its an efficient  effective setup for the character  who is clearly nobodys idea of a hero at the outset

well  our film is like that   
there is no setup  just a succession of punchlines that dont provide for much in the way of chuckles  precisely because there was no setup  
at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity  
and do they make things entertaining  thrilling or even engaging  in the meantime  
for a good ten years or so  super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene  
with an alist cast of oscar laureates like that   twilight  would seem very promising  
the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation  although not up to disney standards  it is still very good with some interesting cgis and very colorful animation  the colors jump out at you very fast  and seem very nicely put on film

she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is  
  i could ask plenty more   
why was it released  
based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie  be happy  i wont bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons   this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend boxoffice  after scoring huge successes with men in black  710   directed by the same man who controlled this one  and independence day  610   
starship troopers was essentially a bmonster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange  a great film thats nearly impossible to find on video  yet showgirls is everywhere   in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins  the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards  who may actually be 45 silicone   in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage  
this is a hard thing to do  but it is absolutely necessary in every way  
starting in the early nineties  we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationshipsfromhell  
leguizamo farts green mist  munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a miniskirt and performs a cheerleader routine  all before turning into a giant grey demon  
nothing  right  
it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire  
we are supposed to be moved  but since the scene is completely unledup to  we really dont care if she and her mother get along  
i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking  used properly it can save a movie  see stigmata   but it ruins this one  making a muddled  incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise  
on the way  they meet some people  have some fun  and clean up some portopotties  
rather than being a story about fatherson  manethnicity  mangod   the prince of egypt  is almost solely about the brotherbrother relationship between rameses and moses  
she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess shes making  
if you see it for free  you could still want to walk out  
oh  and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film  the more i eat  
their realization of the situation that theyre in doesnt happen until they are in the bowels of the boat  
its a large family  but theres not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch  certainly not in the primary trio  
the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons  michael jai white   a government assassinoperative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn  martin sheen  who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip  while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant  
if there had only been more sequences like this  that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music  urban legend mightve been worth your money  
me  i alternated between the two  
instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization  we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage  
instead  stuart places his trust in a  name  star who cant carry the material

what have you done to the indians   
more power to them  
i do have one beef with this aspect of the production  the real life mansion used in exterior shots  nottinghamshires harlaxton manor  is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company  no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins  always finish up in locations that were established in act one  as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house  
he soon shows evidence of mysticalperhaps demonicpower  and his devotion to the womens merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones  
the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work  
theres really very little  if anything  to recommend in the film  
all of them have the means of carrying out the deed  
the same can be said for fortress  1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon  director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond  
the villain here is noticeably lacking  the special effects are ridiculously overblown and unnecessarily complicated  and the script is nonexistent  
at most  i would say the beastmen looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes  
gayheart isnt given as much to do here as she was in 1998s urban legend  but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker  
i know this  too  
one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot whos great at getting out of tight situations  and does it again and again and again  
if you havent already figured it out  i didnt like this movie very much  
when her father dies  she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla  anjelica huston   
of course  if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents  they were all desperately struggling to stay awake  and that included me  
salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets  
the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives  and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found  
as clown  he overacts to the extreme  never missing an opportunity for a poortaste punchline  
arrrghhh   
it shows in the final product  
with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp  
this is just plain depressing  
unfortunately  she is let down by a superficial script  
a quest for vengeance  
even goodman and halperins illconceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing  
blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the grossout  
brace yourself for one of those painfully obvious  surprise endings   
let me put this way  if you like action  get something else  if you like strong women in movies  get something else  if you have do decide between this and  black cat  for your hong kong female action  dont get either  
theres a  halloween h2k  in the works  even though michael myers was beheaded in  h20   and a  freddy vs  jason  has been talked about for awhile  despite the fact that both characters were  killed off   
f   early on  they bait godzilla with fish  
some movies prerelease buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when theyre finally released  everyone just goes along with it  
did childers violate authorized u  s  military rules of engagement  
probably nothing  and so it is  
so    
i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct  and its pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams  
this part of the film was the final straw for me  i couldnt swallow any more goo  
elwes and lewis are both excellent comics  but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating  
the students  junkies  drug dealers  gang members  sleazy sluts  icepick wielders    you 
he is indoctrinated with the big rules  
the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from bmovies in this genre  but it is still an adult rrated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt  
she joins with mr  freeze in his plan to start a new ice age  destroying all animal life  therefore giving her plant creations no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them  
the above is dialogue from this film  taken almost completely in context  and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is  
okay  its an interesting topic  but its not handled greatly  
actually  i smiled a couple of more times on top of that  
  the show is over for this fella   steve buscemis character says towards the end  
as usual  hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars  and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing  
you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners  
the special effects  such as they are  are execrable  
not that cindy does that bad  its just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindys extraordinary acting skills  but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation  
hes already proven that mercury can be broken  
seagals idea of a disguise is a longlength 1000 leather jacket

alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill  rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive  not to mention as dumb as a post through 34 of the film  and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot  
and attracts electrical power  
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life  
d  c  cab has rightly earned its position on  usa up all nite   
what happened  
music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time  
i will give the movie this much  and that is that its main reason for being  its  raisondetre   as the french would say   its fight sequences  do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film  
perhaps  but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue  
side of things  
the film  which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia  certainly contains the type of story to be emotionallycharged  but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings  leaving us with nothing more than a poorlydone courtroom drama  
get john waters  
after all this  whats left  
when i saw the snake for the first time  i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasnt the real danger  
finally  the acting  
false scares should always be used in moderation

the finale with the hestongardnerbujold love triangle is ended in a basic flipofthecoin bit  which brings out a big letdown  
it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film  
mortal kombat  annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off  with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie

when daryl returns  he enters the house  of course  so our heroine is in danger

ben stiller plays stahl  a young author who arrives in l  a  with ambition and a nasty drug habit  
the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here  
even chans socornyitsfunny humor is offkilter in this outing  
under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public  
dont accept the charges  
however  an investigation begins into lizs death and the film becomes excessively dull  
not only was it sloppy in telling its story and getting its facts straight  the acting was mediocre when it should have been energy driven  and i didnt like how smith always magically outsmarted the badies when all the other extra characters  seeming more intelligent than smith  somehow got run over by a truck

all sarcasm aside  it is certainly a different way to start a movie  of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother  so lucky us  we get to see more of jeanclaude

unfortunately  big mommas house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made  instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses  it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters  
if only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li  rodgers could probably have made a decent action film  
but i cant accept not trying

one thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour and town  around 25 people are killed by the ship     and 
although comparisons can be made with this film to deliverance  1972  and the vanishing  1993  plot wise  the latter two are far superior character and script wise  
there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members  leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something  but you never know what  
a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981  paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands

stahl and holmes both show they have talent  but the direction isnt good enough to hone in on their skills  stahls performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads   
meanwhile  most shots take place at night  in dimly lit rooms  or in dark alleys  
  american perfekt  is a waste of time  
in fact  i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax latenight staple if not for the fact that theres absolutely no nudity in it  
a second accuser comes front  suzie toller  neve campbell   a boozedrinkin  tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her  virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions  asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen  
thank you for identifying yourselves  now would you all please go away  
note that the alien movies  id4  and the xfiles are all from 20thcentury fox  a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think  
but storyboards  
it starts off slow  its got no energy  it doesnt engage you with any of its characters  julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film  everyone else    lame    it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward  its utterly predictable  standard  routine  seethrough and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen  big and ugly  waiting    waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing  
is it a film about a nasty  amoral hitman whos in everything for the money  
he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing  chris bauer   and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery  a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie  
chase plays clark griswold really well  
finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie  or should that be mrs  joe   kim dickens   and her boorish fisherman husband  joe  chris cooper   
the writers  when frequently strapped for ideas  tend to turn to this as a source of  comedy   
but theyre not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile  
with the charisma of a pit bull  being tough is all that jack carter knows  
second verse  same as the first   
director richard rush  who once helmed freebie and the bean  doesnt seem to mind  
lastly  armageddon is out there to save the planet  with a capital  p   
a bubble butt   
yes  the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual  identities   they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of  girl power   
as long as you have plenty of narcotics  immunity is guaranteed  
thats not the case with really bad thrillers like this  which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation  the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care  
we cant feel her rage  
the team is killed within seconds  expect for luc  who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive  
she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the kings prejudices  
if  on the other hand  when asked how he learned to speak chinese  bunz simply replied with   kungfu movies   and then moved on  the joke would have been much more effective  
another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero  
the captain of the tug  played by donald sutherland  makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age  looks to be in his 60s   
clich  s are also the order of the day with mission to mars  
whatever david lynch is selling  im not buying  
now  she believes she can use it to breed herself a grandson  
there are scenes shot with different types of film  which are purposely grainy  and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stones natural born killers  
acclaimed director norman jewisons biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun  
  ill give you three guesses  and the first two dont count   
he looks at another character    and 
forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects  
im sure that im not spoiling the ending for anyone  when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again  
ooooooooh  
it is rated r for profanity  violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers  
she stands 58   
im not an overly cynical guy  
 the atmosphere is moody  the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere  
bump unsuspecting women  and    thats all  
the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or  the captain will  personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself   
but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking   
yes  in terms of acting  the star power is  
the first film had neonazis as the random element  this time around  the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role  
grant takes billy along on the kirbys trip  which is really an illegal gambit to save their son  that young paraglider  
michael massees eccentric fbi agent never revs up  
americas sweethearts is the opposite of reality  a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy alsoran  presumably because she wears hornrimmed glasses and used to be overweight  uhhuh   
no dice  
the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through  
  im not enjoying this   the woman protests  
greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime  played by danny aiello   who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes  
the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters  old peter brackett  nick nolte  and young  aspiring sabrina peterson  julia roberts   
pg13 
shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive  
it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate  as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech  
the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high  losing a job  and going into rehab  
you dont want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region  
here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kongrecipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter  
desperate to win over the press  the studio elects to hire lee  billy crystal   a recently fired publicist  to salvage the situation  
no  the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and meanspirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  
its hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesnt do anything exceptionally well  and does quite a few things rather poorly  
if you loved them  dont ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte  
this is the second film in a row  following wing commander  starring freddie prinze jr  which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of shes all that  
j  t  also has ties to jack schmidt  terence stamp   the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him  
the plots utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film  we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie   
the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers  
they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies  
so  theyll crash on the island  and that will be funny for about five minutes   
max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom   dance with the devil and the devil dont change  the devil changes you   
whatever  
also  it is to note that the actress was once named  penthouse pet of the month  in march of 1976  
adults  well  lets just say most will find it unappetizing  
the films main problem is that potter isnt skilled enough to tell the epicsized story of suzie  
it is all explained  in fact  it is all shown onscreen in loving detail  
aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale  there is little else going for the film  
  baywatch  babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her doubleds on the small screen

jays exgirlfriend natasha  vanessa angel  becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else  
no attempt is made to flesh the roles into threedimensional characters  and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them  
billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war  by backing a corrupt government  remember vietnam   with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country  
it looks nicer  and has fewer plotholes within its equally ludicrous framework  
a simple sentence like that  and ive got a nice fourday fishing trip with the boys  or more often than not  a trip up to cherokee  n  c   for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery  
and  independence day  has no balls  
rhea needs  a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom  for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette  chloe sevigny   
this is where everything goes awry  
in this movie  for example  when his girlfriend says that shes kicking him out because hes been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months  he tries to calm the situation by saying   maybe youll feel better after we have some dirty sex   
at the same time  not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives  
maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny  
joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves  you see  
helmer chelsom  who made the outstanding  offbeat comedy  funny bones   is mired in the mess of a script and never puts his imprint on  town  country   
although leachman is best known for comedies like  young frankenstein  and  the mary tyler moore show   her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in  the last picture show   
masters of the universe  
but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast  i mean  can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy   
suicide kings is a terrible film  
when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic  they accidentally murder him  and in desperation  bury the body in the backyard of their aunts house  
now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes  peter coyote  to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s  
that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly  
the  1600  in the movies title doesnt represent an address  it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide  
the special effects  by john dykstra  and production design  by barbara ling  are the primary stars of this film  
in terms of plot  a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky  
on the weekend of the car wash  kellys attempts at seduction fall flat  and when they do  she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day  
this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunnys barber chair  and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers havent learned a thing about ergonomics  
theres no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it  its only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boymeetsgirl subplot  
of course  when weve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time  what else should we expect  
the attack scenes are intensely violent  as one would expect from verhoeven  but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension  
fiennes agent comes across as a dour kid in grownup clothes who has never been out of his home town  
its not a boring film  just not a good one

fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how selfprofessed  gonzo  journalist hunter s  thompson  johnny depp  and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta  benicio del toro   came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorneys convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971  
youve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing  
the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian  famke janssen   argonautica owner canton  anthony heald  and a few other crew members  
it wasnt always this way  
payback has a gritty  metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous  its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months  
i cant buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to  
bruce willis is a resident of the future  and it is a rather bleak future  
why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end  
the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog  and  stigmata  is it  
but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny  
in fact  his death is welcome  because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale  
the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kickoff the apocalypse  
they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns  
wild wild west is a cinematic abomination  a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate  
when they finally get to see their hero  wcw world champion jimmy king  played by oliver platt  
one overalled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel  then theres an inbred father  dwight spurgin  and his two inbred children  mark kettler and jennifer poirrierwallace  that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half doghalf human mix with a shotgun  and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds  
the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus  at that point  
what planet are you from  
evan bonifant   a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band  
michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character  
the prime ministers hideous sidekick  darrell hammond  brings his share of cringes as well  oh no  
there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever  their entire existence is based on punch lines  
mind you  when executed with style and comic ingenuity  jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel  theres something about mary  and a laxativeinduced attack of explosive diarrhea  dumb and dumber  can be extremely funny  
theres just too much of a sitcom feel here  especially during the socalled serious moments  and all the confusion between the characters  
in the morning    
goth veneer aside  there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora  and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them  
the scene feels like an afterthought  its emotion manipulative and shallow  
come on  the guy looks like the gortons fisherman  and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate  
oh well  maybe its good for something  
this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece  deliverance   1972   as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama  hope and glory   1987   the slightly overconceived arthurian epic  excalibur   1981  and the fatherson jungle adventure  the emerald forest   1985   
id like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities  
id have these producers  and everyone else involved in the production of these films  put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity  
rated r  
the plot  as it were  is a series of coincidences combined with extreme leaps of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone tricks  
cant hardly wait  however  does not  
as it stands  trois is pretty standard fare  
the movie was supposedly held up by effects work  but theres nothing special on the screen  
adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor whos just broken up with his activist girlfriend  
its a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man  mr  hugh grant  a huge dork  
if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling  you need a story to justify watching them  
so much for the script  
chris wife commits suicide  
the spook scenes are short and far between  and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide  
one survivor finally does turn up  nadia  joanna pacula   who informs the suicidal and stern captain  donald sutherland  and one of the crew  kit foster  jamie lee curtis   that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship  taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out  
things just defy common sense  
oh yes  very much so  
well  i personally dont care for those films  and didnt really get into the whole  show  atmosphere of this movie either  
no one  and i mean no one  can make a line like  bye bye  mr  knife guy   
if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film  it was studio 54  the late steve rubells infamous new york discotheque  which came to symbolize the taboosmashing excesses of the disco eras heyday  easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone  all set to a thumping dance beat  
mind you  theres nothing wrong with the basic story  
and on it goes  
this is funny the first time just cause it is  but funnier as the film goes on since its totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it  outlined it and then wrote this film  
she actually looks scared during her one love scene  
its also somewhat racist  although it doesnt intend to be  with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching  and actually says slavery is good to save himself  
seagals best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies  to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages  and to do it silently  and alone  
he also  as we are informed early  his own worst enemy  
even hills directing is bellow expectations  battle scenes are too short and  like in many of his late films  force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s  
because thats all that there really is     
i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was  with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy  billy crystal  is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream  
director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two  but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing  
so what about the cast  
after all of this  if you still decide bats might be the movie for you  dont say you havent been warned  
alec who is an obnoxious grouse  someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with  tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book publishedwhich only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni  
it doesnt seem like anyone can read yet they have skidoos and airplanes  
as an injoke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself  
but the people around me appeared to be having a riproaring good time  one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health   
plus  as reeves explains   were all stacked right on top of each other  but we dont notice each other any more   
hes one of the best living actors  
here goes  
theres a few nudge nudge references from the first film  but apart from that  nothing  
maybe the book was better  but the way its handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore  
there is some credit to give to the film however  
thats just the first thirty minutes  
on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members  gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late  
  keep reading  
at its best  the acting can barely be called  adequate  and the script couldve definitely used a rewrite or two  
birthdays often cause individuals to access their lives  
alcohol  lots of it  may have helped the viewing experience  
a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly  
when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover  there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal  he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film  
ok  so those arent exactly the words he uses  but its probably one of the few clich  s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies   king kong   
jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob  
i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors  and he chews the scenery in this movie  brilliant as ever  
webb marches over to the table  gets up in her face and says   just what kind of a dame do you think you are   
unfortunately  twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length  and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome  
a little imagination goes a long way  
one is dr  evils son  there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group  chaired by carrie fisher  and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch  its a visual gag  hard to describe  and hard to recommend seeing the movie for   
these two are so comically talented they can take bad material and still deliver the goods  
im never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people  several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing  but i know that when a filmmaker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that its an entire film  i duck out of the way  
because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner  but they essentially behave as human savages  in another lapse of imagination  
   
malicious certainly isnt the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks  a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there   but it isnt all that good or original either  
the story  for those of you who missed childhood  is simple  
kurt russell is o  k as jeff  although he can seemingly only pull of one expression  which is angry  
however   mystery men  proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999  
the acting  and script  the plot  and ending  
i hate every element of the film  beginning with tom shadyacs shameless direction  and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey  
he is also an excellent judge of character  knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witnesss testimony  
the whole film  since it is primarily a  buddy picture   depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other  
how are these things powered  
take the scene where austin powers  again played by mike myers  but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously  confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff  
eventually though  even the most welltrained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson  
as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov  a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre   and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked  
who knows  who cares  this  satire  sucks the bag  
and the monster gets to pick them off one by one  
getting to the latter  however  requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story  
based on the popular 50s sitcom  sgt  
all up  it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered  fabricated or newly created sequences  
there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good  this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall  clever huh  
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson  
tom green cowrites  with  tom green show  scribe derek harvie   directs and stars in what is essentially tom greens primal scream  
i think the final straw would be when cage returns home  devastated by everything that hes seen on this case  and then is no longer able to rake his lawn  
any paralells that you might have heard before  linking this picture to kubricks  the shining   are absolutely baseless  
he does it well  i guess  but this is no  alfie   
occasionally  however  films like say anything  dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called  teenagers   
jb  yes  
once the film gets going  in its own sluggish way   it delves into a series of jungle adventures  as tarzan  jane  and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city  
so patch decides that hes going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have  
now  in all fairness  i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending  however stupid it may be  had it not been revealed to me before hand  
after that  the movie and the book begin the same  with the murder of jack williams  frederick downs   a onearmed detective and hammers best friend  
if this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film  then i agree with laurence fishburnes sentiment   god help us   
well to start this off id just like to say a couple things  
aw    
in a movie like this  you notice the strings being pushed  and you sit there  comatose  hoping it will end  
plus  the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy  albeit  nineties   agent are a waste of time  
its relatively easy to see where this new story is going from the onset  yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes  
the film  which runs about 80 or so minutes  just needs to work on these things  and become a lot less sloppy  
the story involves a veteran publicist  billy crystal  who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director  christopher walken  holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room  refusing to show it to anyone  
we the audience  seeing a high tech riflely gadget  of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target  but instead  he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy  lowquality photographs  which eye then proceeds to fax and email to everyone in his targets office  
naturally  this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government  
the story is stuffed with ridiculous  formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick  
this subplot is completely a waste of garofalos talent  
the villains  pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern  are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber  
if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity  someone needs to get the man some drugs  pronto  
then  in this final week before its official release  i learned that it was not to be screened for critics  
and the sense of scary atmosphere  which was recently done so well in the others  is nowhere to be found here  
the film comes briefly to life  
i admire mr  burton for trying to do more then entertain  but the result is a mess  
that is  if it hasnt already disappeared entirely after this fiasco  
for all the blood and gore  nudity  and sex thrown in  species ii is  quite simply  a vapid bore  
however  a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators  as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables  
theres a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending  but here they are far too obvious  
sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts  but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters  
but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand  
the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1  000 years earlier  and if that is the case then were going to get into a whole bunch of problems later  trust me    
despite our greatest hopes  there is no life on the red planet  
look at small portions of it and makes sense  
although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life  the film itself doesnt appear to have a brain in its head  
  walkers  seven  did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise   
still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all  she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown  
because of them  movie seems a little bit too long  and boring at times  
epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected  although their characters arent nearly as rich as danes could have been  
many bad films have good intentions  but my favourite martian doesnt appear to try to provide any entertainment  
note to self  avoid universal soldier 2  the return upon release in august  99  
youre forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff  
why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them  but is conveniently able to leap atop others  
she fails to imbue estella  a remote character in the book  with even the vaguest traces of humanity  
after some stupid talking scenes  they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to  
what he shouldve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich  
the plot follows two married  megamovie stars  gwen and eddie  zetajones and poor  poor john cusack  whose material gets worse every year   on the eve of their new star vehicles release  a film called time over time  
the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis  dune   a windswept desert planet thats home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange

the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky  characterheavy baseball movie like  bull durham   but havent got a clue how to get there  
the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place  
golly  
in fact  this could be the unfunniest movie ive seen in a long time  if not the unfunniest  
maybe if the illfated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned out better  
paul tannek  jason biggs  is a smalltown boy who gets a scholarship to nyu  then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the coldhearted big city

fred macmurrays flying model t has been replaced by a tbird  
ill admit it    
shes convicted of his murder  of course  and leaves her son matty  benjamin weir  with her best friend  annabeth gish   
theyre all pointless gimmicks though  such as shots of the innerworkings of a knock off running shoe  
just as unlikely  
for a few  fleeting  maddening moments  director stephen frears  dangerous liaisons  gets everything just right the tone  the colors  the characters  all the ingredients to make a mostpowerful potion out of valerie martins bestselling novel  
though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of  he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out moneymaking opportunities  from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4d pools  
well  i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over  but that would have been too obvious

with the exit of bill murray  the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go  and thats    
i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place  but  
treat williams  looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse  is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie  
though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts  this director is loaded with hokum  all he has learned how to do  is hide the hokum better  
eve marks  meg ryan  just put her father lou mozell  walter matthau  into a hospital  
he was a principal player in last years in the company of men  a film that was more powerful  shocking  terrifying  funny  and shocking than armageddon could ever aspire to be  
  
works  for harry  and loves grace  harrys daughter  
yea  
bicentennial man is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment  
over the years  the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material  
this kind of rubbish will just not do at all  
this subplot is extremely boring and dull  and i am getting quite sick of plots like that  
after confessing to her mother  theresa russell  that she was raped  she goes to the police station  where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette  kevin bacon  and gloria perez  daphne rubinvega   
although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission  they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts  
but when a movie is so selfaware it becomes about nothing but itself  we can hardly be expected to pay for admission  
his acting is so overthetop that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself  
whats most troubling about the film  however  isnt the unsettling subject matter and the matteroffact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material  
the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax  
made on a pittance  the film features an almost exclusively asianamerican cast  
will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monicas two firefighting buddies  
what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign  kevin is a sitcom writer brought in to punch up the republican candidates speeches  while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate  
suicidebad  
the girls accidentlly open the box  big surprise  huh   and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one  betcha didnt see that one coming    
therons  advocate  character faced a similar dilemma  the horror there resonating strongly  
  never mind that the baku didnt exactly evolvethey went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world   
ive seen more convincing drama  with nearly as much bare flesh  on that pinnacle of narrative quality  baywatch  
theres no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness  
some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair  but theyre so obvious to me  
how will loveless accomplish this  
the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east  and i dont mean new york city  
in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences  ramseys script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar  poetic rhythms of tarantino or mametstyle dialogue  
is he a villain  
the script  however  is painfully bad  
this was one of many glaring inconsistencies  
apparently  this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical  
in batman forever and now in batman  robin hes almost pushed to being a bit player  
they call me darlene   
even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character  not one child even bothered to smirk  
the answer is simple  
jazz has an idea for a local talk show  it would feature women talking about sex and dating  
a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi  though  because alex proyas cant film a decent action scene to save his life  
racism passing as humor  gosh why didnt anybody ever think of that one before  
the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish  thus we cant take him and his motives seriously  and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment  he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig  and kills some workers who were just doing his job  
the writers had  and blew  a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines  
the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it  because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes  embarrassing cameo appearances  george burns   
uhhhhhm  unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked  
from then on  forget scifi    this 
first of all  the jackson character is not hard to judge  theres no tension in his dilemma  
the badness of patch adams is stupefying  
director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects  
two months earlier  lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer  and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere  
in an obvious homage  the millionaires name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have  
1970s nostalgia is already wearing off  and now  people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s  
the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end  
the film itself has absolutely no concern with story  only with hurtling forth to the next  special  effect  
when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing  paulie cringes  
i suspect that  the 13th warrior  had a better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tagteam direction  
the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out  
he shouts at everyone  from cops to priests  to the devil  
but like i said  i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization  
in this case  drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch  
as it turns out  theres some other nonsense going on here  involving and revolving around jerrys background  
blame said editors for the films frightful flashbacks  as well  
firestorms director  dean semler  is a former cinematographer  he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves   so its no surprise that the film looks good  
and singer sinead oconnor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice  
poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer  
these sub plots could have made for semiinteresting points  but the film seems afraid to explore politics or motherdaughter relations in depth  and consequently suffers  
the music is blaring  the floors moving  the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming  and all of this  every second  every moment of screen time  is absolutely without life  
here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and mariesylvie deveu  that have wisely replaced the well known screammask with a very elegant fencing mask  
instead  the film just gives quirky a bad name  
especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown  and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film  
i guess brad pitt was right for this role  because i felt like beating him up myself  
this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime  the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there  
furthermore  the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  
expect armageddon  lds to retail at s19  90 at carrefour come release time  
hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile  
randy quaid sneers a lot  and is totally unconvincing  
with no music and no budget to work with  the film has to depend on natural  psychological scares  which are sometimes well delivered  sometimes not  
this sleazy pic  soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears  
the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body  
throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending  will  son of chucky  be next   and this is a bizarrely bad 89minutes at the movies  
when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died  the snowman outside the house is taken over by jacks spirit  
mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here  in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success  his previous widerelease picture  mad dog and glory  was a boxoffice disappointment   
a cook in under seige 2  seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble  
moviegoing experience  
a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom  
compelling  but ultimately not  
when he does make a run for it  connor offers close pursuit  but for different reasons than his superiors  including the crusty brian cox   they want to take mccabe down  while connor needs to keep him alive  or all hope is lost for his little boy  
with logic like that  this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewers eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult  
but  there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin and buck henry and this is  tcs  downfall  
leder loves to show the actors faces before and during moments of terror  
hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance  which was utterly convincing  and the supporting cast was excellent  though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel  
it shouldnt take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr  pitt  
is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open  
its mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into  feeling  for the characters  but it didnt work for me  
his wife emily  gwyneth paltrow  is a highlyplaced un interpreter and is not happy with her life either  
thing  
he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18 million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier  which  by the way  is somehow due to schmidt  
unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart  the  alan smithee  version remains the closest well get to what the movie should have been  
except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy  that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through  
swordfish is a very cynical movie  
the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending  
all views are the authors  but copyright is held by robinsonblackmore  1998  
she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank  but also banishes them to hell or oblivion  were not too sure which  
a hunter  chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends  gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape  
yea  its only make believe  but that doesnt mean you have to tolerate it  
and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film  
we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do  
everything is wrong about this movie  the performances are forced  and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters  
yep  
maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies  they would grow into the big screen  
what better for the farrelly brothers  famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter  than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality  
screwed perfectly suits the latter description  
after watching anightattheroxbury  youll be left with exactly the same  
all he wants is the girl  that is somehow special  
it wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence  but its a pretty good place to start  
this effort is utterly limp and lifeless  
this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character  which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around  
dont go see meet joe black  because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death  
yeah  you  ferrara  
i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some threehour exercise in spirituality  but unfortunately for me  it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging  
the generals daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film  it pretends to have a soul  to be of strict moral code  when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cutouts forcefeeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and onesided moral judgments  
he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents  
the happy bastards quick movie review 
first  there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105minute movie  
  texas chainsaw massacre  the next generation  is being called a sequel  but its really more of a remake of the original  
the jaded detective  patrick dempsey   
why wouldnt they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine  
blanchetts lola  a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie  is bold  interesting and layered  everything our heroine lacks

in the films most outrageous scene  joan realises that some of her daughters clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers  
this film  as some of his do  has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented  but dont appear to be in this film  
an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs  spousal abuse  a boxing career  and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way  rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character  
there is some action in this film  but its directed in such an annoying way  its just infuriating to watch  
the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing  although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away  
daniel craig  in a lifeless performance  plays the burglar and boxer  george dyer  
screenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie  
over the course of the weekend  the three men face various crises  including vics blind date from hell  janeane garofolo  and donnys growing estrangement from emma

he takes it home  somehow getting it past customs    and starts fiddling with it in his attic  
  back to the minors  is a movie that has no reason to exist  
  
although the mayor doesnt seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up  a few members of the city council are  
drawing from frederick knotts play and loosely based on hitchcocks dial m for murder  this is alltoo typical of summer releases  
by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred  mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush  
watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell  stockpiling quirks in the name of cool  
i came up with four  goddamns   three  shitheads  and two  fucks   
beyond an ability to use skindiving gear  no special talents are required of him  
hes worse than a generic bad guy  hes a boring generic bad guy who doesnt have any snappy oneliners to hurl at our big burly hero  
ive never seen a movie work so hard and in so little time to destroy  systematically  any chance of being credible or interesting  
even beside the tarzan comparison  instinct just isnt a very good film  
perez might have some screen presence if hes given something to do with himself  but here hes simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face  
let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years  
then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud  very obnoxious heavy metal music  
this film can boast of great sound  fast paced editing  solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences  
everyones either having sex  exacting revenge  or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge  
  jungle 2 jungle  is probably the worst film i saw last year  
the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe  
and i dont like saying that either  since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well  
and for gods sake  mike nichols directed the graduate  and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty  
mcconaugheys character makes an important slipup late in the movie  when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense  
more carnage ensues  
cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end  as cute as the crab maybe  
cage plays rick santoro  a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money  
some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed  but im not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so  
we get steals from russ meyer movies  where everybody in town is horny and sweaty  
but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster  
the picture is a remake of the 1949 film  
since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris  at least not in this kind of movie  the biggest attraction of this film should have been action  
maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel  
this  erotic  set piece  a cultish bacchanal complete with chanting  incense  and lots of strategicallyplaced partygoers covering up the dirty  might impress the likes of hugh hefner  but its a lot less shocking than its intended to be  
the  anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying  running  for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky  sounds fine  right  
she frowns  she yells  she babblesshe blows chunks  
having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the  day one    day two  titlecard device underscores the tedium  
what do they need to do  
theres a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on  when jeanne  as a young girl  watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier  
in an early scene of the film  for example  the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets  
there are a couple of funny oneliners  but mostly just rehashed onejoke scenes  a lot of dead silence and lame gags  
this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know  but can also illustrate societies  
we trusted him  
pass the kleenex  
dune  the theatrical version  1984  runtime  137 minutes capsule review  cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives  the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book  
in the original movie  the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive      in this movie it felt more like   well people  were gonna run into that there island in a few hours  i think i might stroll over to engineering and see if i cant turn off the engines    im 
ultimately  this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise  joins the crew in their  misadventures in space  for the main crux of its journey  and eventually settles down for one of the most anticlimactic endings this side of contact  
neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the films musical score during the last fifteen minutes  presumably in order to wake the audience up  okay  we get it brian  this scene is supposed to be powerful    wow    yawn    my 
its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next  
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark  henry fonda in once upon a time in the west  or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it  
with an eighty million dollar budget  youd think that entrapment would at least feature edgeofyour seat action scenes or breathtaking special fx  
witherspoon has a truly beautiful face  but her character isnt the moral staple shes supposed to be  sure  she wont have sex until shes in love  is this really a  moral  issue    but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible  
so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick  played with little zest by lazard  
luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film  
nonetheless  someone out there thought shed make a good lawyer  but were reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes  
but nether the less  armored guard couriers tom  christian slater  and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van  
people wanting to see kiss  and lots of it will probably be disappointed  considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song  
of the tv star cameos  john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist  
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brothers films while writing their own dialogue  
it was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for bluer jokes or to maintain the innocent jokes success of most of its predecessors  
but it doesnt really matter  
by the end  i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed  
yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison  i can only hope people will change their minds and think of  batman  as the superior adaptation  
guess again  he gets interested in the final frames   theres genieveve bujolds moron son  who has a little adventure with wires  and for some muchneeded comedy  theres walter matthau  billed as walter mutha     
a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie  but its desperate rather than clever  
and where does this characters personality change  
thus  babe 2 arrives  with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1  
meanwhile  another villain shows up  poison ivy  uma    who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist  john glover  who kills her when she finds out hes used her research to develop an uberman  bane  who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had  
nearly every man in the movie  in fact  is played as the same sort of sexdriven slimeball  
theres a few changes here and there  but its essentially the same  even the infamous  meathook  scene has been recreated   
he has a chiseled body full of tattoos  
well entertain you plenty with that kind of money   
mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life  his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit  
it all seems so harmless in the beginning  
the bards work is apparently beyond criticism  
orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film   to movies    to 
his first feature was the starstudded disaster  con air   but my opinion of him improved with  the generals daughter   which was thick with sultry atmosphere  
dont be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on  
the characters are incredibly meanspirited  
the characters in arizona are funny  and theres also a good scene where robbins asks a shopkeeper which threatening approach was better  lawerences  which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeepers ass  and swearing a lot   or himselfs   which was speaking in a deep  scary voice  but the gags are predictable  the lack of chemistry infurating  and the ending too farfetched and perfect 
and this predictability isnt reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men  it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen  
  one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes  
furthermore  there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyones life to present this story  
words i thought id never write  the sequel to urban legend lacks the grace  wit  and power of the original

the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought  with one through five dispatched in a fiveminute montage  
how about the action  
instead  they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band

in this film  ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend  
quite frankly its insulting  
as i write this  i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based  
this film uses a lot of formula  the plot is basically known from the opening credits   
perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld

now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya  daniel baldwin   
here  the characters are too aware of themselves as popculture icons  and theyre even more onenote  
well  if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive  theyve done a swell job here  
this means james must present his new  friend  in the stickiest of situations  a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace  heather locklear   also attended by her uberrich parents  veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino

what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins character needs to turn himself into a popsicle  except to invoke an emotional response  i could think of at least one way to save him  and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be  smarter  than i am   
how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions

given a better script  better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time  the film almost went for two hoursor did it just feel like it    this film might  and i mean  might   have turned out okay  but as it is  it is stocked with the worst action film cliches  whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time  
there is not an ounce of intelligence  or excitement in   john carpenters vamires   which is very disheartening coming from an exfan of carpenters  
we have the alien bounty hunters  the desert skif technology  stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that  deja vu  is too polite a term to use in describing it  
along the way  you can expect a lot of sh jokes as well  
even though the first movie wasnt a great film  it was definately an enjoyable wellmade movie with an actual thin storyline  
the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not id actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled  
after this  the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural  
sutherland is wasted and baldwin  well  hes acting like a baldwin  of course  
adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film  
also  it being one day later  it cant be friday the 13th now can it  
the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like  auto stud    college stud   and  high school stud 2   
so  by golly  where did this mission go wrong  
it sure starts off nicely  but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable  
a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy  including the overused  folks hiding in the bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap and fart  gag  
he even does his captain kirk impersonation  
the result  
so i saw  supernova   
fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze   pokemon  the movie 2000  which is far inferior to the original animated movie  
he quickly finds  not greatly to any surprise he shows  that on this planet apes rule and humans drool  but everybody talks

gang extracts revenge on crooked cop  
movie review by mikel j  koven 
as the story opens  an angry gloria  stone  is being released from prison after 3 years confinement  
theres one scene where schneider looks through the ships pantry in disgust  holds one food can up and announces   this expired in 1966   
he loves poetry and great literary works  but his class is more interested in his famous former student  played by matt dillon  
im optimistic about nothing   
the idea of spinning artist james obarrs original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie  taking its own righteous vengeance against the world  
also no points for guessing garofalo hates ohara on sight  
most will recognize him as the highflying robin from the two latest batman films  but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile  
  with all that education  you should know what happiness is   
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land  
i call it pretentious  
the result is merely an academic exercise  leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldnt build on to show them as the poets they were  
general thade  tim roth   lucky numbers   is of the opposite opinion  wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race  
its all truethree men on a raft  u  s  a   19421986  director  orson welles

i was about fortyfive minutes into this one at a friends house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house  
television is whats wrong with deep impact  
the cast is still impressive  but here  not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction  hes one of those directors whos good with actors  terrible with camera angles   but writer akiva goldsmith doesnt really give an impressive cast anything to do  
meanwhile  the newlywed keith ends up consoling dans wife rowena  gail ogrady  in bed  
think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends  
though wainwrights vanity certainly doesnt help  he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script  
one day  a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the mans living room  opening into the ceiling of the womans living room  
an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer  
the movie convincingly argues that francis  played by jacobi  was a completely despicable and vain individual  but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude  
there  through a twoway mirror  he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay  
but after a while  this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one  
i would call you a boob mel  but that insults breasts everywhere  
the worst flaw of the film is this  its boring  
this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy  but for a film called dirtywork  what ensues is rather clean of spirit  
that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas  as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor  
in another scene  he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades  
i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody  
please guys  go back to england and go back to television so youll make me laugh again  
oh  ive got it   
benings character perhaps was the most difficult to watch  especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty    
back in london gang boss teddy bass  ian mcshane  tvs lovejoy  is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal  
what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie  
maybe  if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode  
as the villainous icon cruella devil  she tears up the screen in a deliciously overthetop performance  
are mass groups of people simultaneously that interested in total strangers  
its long and its just not very good  
walsh and lee garlington  go out to a party  
a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls  who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chestbeating bravery  
secondly  the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed  
the rape occurred in west point  which is in new york  
in fact  my insults dont even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time  
but his action scenes are never boring  one particular piece inside of a fruit factory  a fruit factory   is wellchoreographed  
not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie  
both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film   ebert   the mayor of new york  is played by michael lerner  and  gene   lorry goldman  is his campaign manager  
so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect  
its all way too much for him  
when the man and the woman dance  it seems halfhearted and listless  
much carnage ensues  
but i managed to catch it before it made its way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and  god forbid  video cassette purchasing  
while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to whats exactly going on  the second half dissolves into standard ghost story stuff and loses some of its suspense  
the flying inkpot rating system   wait for the tv2 broadcast  
insert proverbial downward spiral here  
he was one of the more consistently funny performers on saturdaynightlive before his muchtalkedabout firing  and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen  it also doesnt hurt that hes a natural  likable screen presence  
i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater  
garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival  during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss  
sexual innuendoes are tossed around  much hard liquor  beer  and pot is consumed  and nothing much else happens  
sean dies  leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty  made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her  
stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue  sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset  
heres the catch  they must reunite princess katana  talia soto   whos on the good side  with her resurrected mother queen sindel  musetta vander   whos on the bad side  for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanitys safety for another generation  
she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film  except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter  or any of the viewers in the audience  
      perfection  
one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were  least of all certainly not john  who  played by van der beek  of tvs  dawsons creek    is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities  
the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny  or at the least  satirical  
those days are gone  
this creates not only friction between the brothers  but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well  
sexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them  but he will not even kiss them  
and that car rolling off the cliff  
thats the main problem with the avengers  for all its hiphop flash and tidal waves  none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired  
perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie  
for sheer cinematic disaster  
dune is also a very serous film  
its not funny  its pathetic and brainless  
youll only encourage the producers to make more just like it  
so  undoubtedly one day someone said   evolution   
yet  despite the predictable nature of this film  there are some scary  boo  moments  
call it suspension of disbelief  
in it  one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another  and he says to her something along the lines of  do you ever wonder what life is all about   
its during the time of the depression  and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs  or are poor  
look  ill be honest here  
the few guys that arent particularly slimeballs  such as john goodmans detective character  are simply uncommunicative workaholics  
once there  the immortals label him a  brutal  and study him like a lab rat  taking great  perverse care in exploring his sexuality  which is a mystery to them  
youll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place  
davidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror  whom he wisely joins  
directed without any imagination by steve boyum  whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction  the film limps along at best  
this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original films sil  but its close enough  and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy  engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find  
speaking of  pig   or   pigpigpigpigpig    
rather  you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that theyre in  that you stop caring about who lives  who dies and where the story goes  
d  c  cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher  who would go on to direct batman forever  about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs  
  metro  is a film that lasted a little too long  but it was still entertaining  and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end  
others    
theres a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie  like the abuse angel takes from her hustler exboyfriend  
mr  freeze and poison ivy  uma thurman  leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond  
he was once an aspiring actor  
its supposed to be a thriller  but the plot is dead on its feet  and ultimately arbitrary  its only put into the movie to jerk us around  
and let the comedy begin  
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance  
 the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently  
no such luck with  picture perfect   
look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases  and youll see a shocking list of retreads  including 101 dalmatians  george of the jungle  jungle2jungle  that darn cat   flubber  and now mr  
for each nifty trick tsui pulls off  such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices  there are others that are completely superfluous  
saving  varsity blues  from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences  including one set in the sex education class  which did get a laugh out of me  
as far as musical comedies go  isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical  but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy  
there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch  
to be fair  though  the lack of story background is the least of the movies problems  
the sunrise studios site  scream3  com  has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the  latest stab 3 news

gender be damned  shes borderline inept

this was the third one of 97  following the very lackluster  the saint   which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe  and the surprisingly fun  the peacemaker   featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain  
with only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c  g  i 
but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about  
with every shot of his hand  we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge  
unfortunately  he just doesnt demonstrate it at all in this movie  
when she sees a trio of babealicious barkeeps thumbing through a stack of 20s in an allnight diner  violet simply has to check out this bar they call coyote ugly  
on a horse  boo

did i miss something  
while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself  the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation  rather than because the film demanded it  
not funny  tiresome  
that little fact has been used as justification for the films existence  that the butabis newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters  
perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient  effort and ideas

loveless has taken the countrys top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control  using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns

it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr  got involved in this oneweekoldbluecheesesmelling project  
message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come  1998  as one of the most misguided romances of the decade  
you can figure out the rest from here  
perhaps worst of all  down to you is not funny  
its all very routine and uninteresting because there arent any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense  
it also sickens me to know that oliver stone  one of the greatest directors working today  had his hand in producing this monstrosity  
the bug does its job  the cockroaches all die  and the terror is gone

in such times  when political involvement could be associated with noble passion  many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of prewar europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany  
the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series  
i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997s batman and robin  
his name is frank langella  
the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story  no underlying thing that the movie is really about

it is for this film that he will be remembered  while all his other failures will be forgotten

in times of crisis people are driven to desperate measures  
this time  a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling  if that aint a stereotype     
the jokes are crude  the characters are mean to the core  the attitude of the movie is that it just doesnt care  
his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows  tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion  
the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielbergs the lost world than the 1949 original  with the computergenerated trexi mean  joewreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore  the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third  with jill shouting   look  joes headed for the movie theatre

theres no feeling that the director really cares about his story  more than any other film ive seen this year  this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line

in fact  the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind  
but beneath the shiny wrapper  there isnt nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe  
the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking

its a poor attempt to win over the audience  
the film has good moments  many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear  especially his confrontation with zellweger   an almost soothing  lyrical score  and you know a movies in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it  but nothing jells  its parts  good or bad  are so disparate as to be opposing  
it sure aint character development  
the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco  but its still pretty boring  
everythings overly surreal  and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex  
of course  it doesnt  
sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south  
unfortunately  much of whats discussed in the film is not inherently important to whats going on  but instead filler that starts out with potential  but ends up just being extraneous because its never followed through  
not a watchable film in the bunch  
guffaws will also likely greet charlton hestons cameo as thades father  the one ape harboring a firearm    who sputters some very familiar lines before dying  
spotting a young tree she doesnt like the look of  she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line  tina   
they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy  on the level of ghostbusters  and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones  
in fact  the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation  i think lynch is merely playing a joke  
one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset  
thats another main element of watchers reborn  
dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer  a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare  
anyway  getting back to the thing you might call plot  johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry  while his girl and the other dude are in the same league  
eliot  corbin allred  reader  
this movie proves it for me  
this one is for the truly pious  
now   the 13th warrior  presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears  
an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis 1981 feature  an american werewolf in london  
every disaster movie has to have a knowitall scientist  and this time broderick is it  
she is engaged to walter  an allergyprone working man and seems to be perfectly content  
so why was it made  
gary oldmans performance is disappointingly weak  he seems nearly bored  
pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo  but her character seems extraneous to the story  well  at least until the final scenes  
her response is   they have weapons and technology  
while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and humanity into the proceedings  the rest of the cast are plodding unexceptional  
the others are horrendous  
in the fight  the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker  but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost  
im not saying i like the film now  so dont start going anywhere  
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written  and he seems unsure of how to handle the material  
another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to  
i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie  because he  or she  has a peculiar notion of eroticism  
she now wants her own identity and her independence  
he succeeds once again  
2  they have better and younger talent  performers and wrestlers  
from there  one set of stoned adventures after another happens  including one of the few good scenes in which depp  high on acid  watches all the people in the bar around him turn into  literally  lounge lizards  
on the tv news  it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers  
if it was a thriller  there was little to keep us entranced  
there is  however  a lost pyramid  which i suppose is all the resourcestrapped fx department could come up with  the special effects are not worthy of a madefortv movie   
the dialogue  in all manner of speaking  is unspeakable  
after each killing  she puts on a different wig  assumes a new name  and then makes her way to another state  
theres too much about sue that doesnt make sense  
doo doo doo doo  
well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you  
as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant  al is befriended by jason  and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene  
  even with that little information  you can probably already guess what the killers relationship to sidney is   
apparently  james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold  
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside  
certain story elements are too coincidental  
although in one sense it may seem tedious  making a movie about the ugliness of greed  not box office material   it does become tedious  not because of the morale ending  but because one expects the movie to end that way  
in the meantime  billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom  
soon enough  fake  and real  blood starts to flow  and amy is being chased around by scary killer  while her cast and crew get slain  one by one  
this time  willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u  s  army  who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax  
but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten  which  in simpler terms  means it comes in at number 6 on my  worst of 1997  list  
if you have never seen it  
battlefield earth 
this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully  the bully looks at the  rebel  threateningly  about to hurt him  and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too  
it begins in a new york city bloomingdales  a product placement that rivals cast aways fedex for sheer blatancy  
well lets see    im 
conair was ridiculousy dumb in  its premise but it did have fun moments  and who can forget the nursery  rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi  
with a total of 4 decent films  its not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing  
and from there  once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur  its all downhill  
but morals are not the point of this filmtopping each bloated  confusing action scene with next one is  
i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights  
t  kirk   
welles certainly makes it look easy  
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompsons book  and there are some priceless comic observations  
unfortunately  director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute  
shades of broadcast news    
on a team of professionals  she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link  
the amorous couple is one  
its a vivid setting  but an unappealing one  especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background  
to sum the entire film  54  up in one sentence  it would be  watch a vh1 documentary instead  
thats interesting but the movie doesnt do anything with it other than crash land the subtheme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle  
the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore  and its continous attempt to gross us out  starting early on when richards character vomits onscreen   
add to this the films fauxmysticism  including spirit animals and dream visions  and a narrator who sounds like a psychic youd expect to hear on a 1900 number  and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious  
i cant blame the actors  though  
out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment  she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents apartment building  mr  apfelschnitt  topol   tells her about  
that isnt easy  because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways  
much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout  and some left the theatre  
i am hoping that in my little rant ive made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing  so if you go see it and you dont like it because of this dont blame me  
and every now and again  as  shattered image  makes agonizingly clear  it isnt  
the only semisaving grace actorwise is tim roth as the irrepressible  bad guy   but once again  its not something that we havent seen before    a 
m  i2 opens and closes with fastpaced action scenes  but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue  
the first image in  final fantasy  the spirits within  is a computeranimated closeup of a human eye  
fight club means what you want it to mean  i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about  
  batman and robin  has far more in common with the campy 60s batman tv show than with tim burtons tale of darkness  
anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeos wife  
how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open  
the brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags  despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe   but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected  
godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags and fart jokes  
synopsis  nice girl susanne has sex with her boyfriend daniel in his car  visits daniels rich family during thanksgiving at their mansion in the middle of nowhere  and has sex with daniel again in the basement  
one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen  
queen amidala is a nothing in the film  she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must serve her people   and go googoo over anakin  
films like this has one serious weakness  logic  
knock off seems to have an interesting premise  as far as action films go   but theres no semblance here  
so its hard to imagine that it can be stretched to 2 hours  
and it leaves itself open to a sequel  which probably wont ever be made  
but as more and more people find out about their scheme  more and more people demand a part of their winnings  and more and more problems arise  
the plot moves nowhere fast  and only becomes exciting in very short bursts  
scifi fans take note  there are brief appearances from stephen collins  star trek  the motion picture  and faye grant  the tv miniseries  v  and  v  the final battle    
this requires at least some acting skills  
two of them are assigned to cover the train collision  
the fact is  george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects  
its not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him  but a few laughs would have been helpful  
in the films major subplot  data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions  a chip he has had in his possession for over a year  
or original  
diedre  at the same time  murders a bunch of people  
however  his latest creation  in praise of love  is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year  
predictable  unoriginal  and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to yous and the drive me crazys released by the dozens these last couple of years  
you would think so  wouldnt you  
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension  theyve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs  
see it for zetajones  or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going  and provide very little payback  otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld  the shining  
alas  these are only hints  
when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy  i expect negative reviews from critics left and right  
review by chris hill  
when they reach the secluded island  they discover it is the last day of the open season  and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them  
hc  heres the 11 pitch  
the film ends on a whimper    with 
this is never answered  as this film is too cluttered  
cut to random guy with eye patch    
we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend  
wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield  which is going broke  unless phillip can invent something to save the day  
his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else  since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment  
there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully  jonathan demmes something wild and neil jordans the crying game come to mind   but they didnt try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment  
i suppose deep risings gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre  but it doesnt do much for me  
already weak on material  it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs broads and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction  
when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements  or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch  theres a muchneeded dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair  
heres the dumb part of it  he somehow manages to throw the man to safety as his legs are melting  
i love sean connery  
as voiced by sean connery   draco  is a surprisingly expressive creation who is welldeserving of his 23 minutes of screen time  
theres a good chance youll regret it  
i guess ill stick to that other survival spectacle  you know the one on cbs  
next  theres mighty mack  john goodman   a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band  
  2  00  
too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor  
even worse  its a bore  
one thing that i must say  simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results  
heck  i can do it in one sentence  giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it  
creature from outer space    but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on  
unlike rocker tommy lee  woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180  
one particular field manual is known as the fm 225  which among other things  covers the practice of saluting  
im surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once  not twice  but three times to review these discs  
the camera cuts all over the place  disoreitating the audience  and instead of involving the audience in the action  it merely alienates them  
again  
my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent  because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously  written   that we just had to crack up  
tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels  knockoff  but this time around  style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous  and at worst incomprehensible  nor hide a host of truly lousy performances  
paul walker  the strapping quarterback from varsity blues  is bland but passable as caleb mandrake  the judges son  
existenz is too predictable and cliched in these times  
recommendation  turn off your brain  dont be like me  decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much  
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny  and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff  chasing the blues brothers band  
the film should serve as another in the longline of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays  
error  
these days  its usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path  
it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music  and the reunification of people  
luckily  the xfiles movie is coming up  and hopefully armageddon will be more successful  
the film jaunts along from scene to scene  never fully explaining what is going on  
if there is a movie theater in hell  this film is playing there 24 hours a day  
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book  
isnt the most important part of an action film  well  the action  
a line of students is outside at night  peering through telescopes at the dark sky above  
the special effects of  monkey bone  is what might really bring in some curious viewers  these special effects are highly effective  and nice to look at with the eyes  
this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because    well  
one of the funniest lines in the movie flies by  when asked to comment on the clitoris  dont ask   jay responds   the female clitoris   
its really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this  
porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley  idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that hes gay  
in this aspect of its production  as in so many others  godzilla is lacking  
its as if he had a great story to tell  but instead opted for the easier route  
what doesnt make sense is how such highprofile and superb actors as john travolta  robert duvall  william h  macy  and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project  which is both dull and completely ineffective  
one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped  when cisco gets there  paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it  but they let him out of there  telling him to find the perpetrator  
steven spielberg is picked on in particular  
this is basically the whole plot  
murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life  which is really neither here nor there  
ladies and gentlemen  payback is the most expensive episode of  the equalizer  ive ever seen  
no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work  and this movie makes a vain attempt at that  
their lone suspect is wayland  tim roth   a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hookers pocket  
some shady u  s government guys appear  and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints  from what looks like a giant lizard  
     amazing  potent stuff  
ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure  and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmies marital adventures  
the score is boomy and adventurous  powerful  and a billion times better than this film is  
these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality  
the film isnt all bad though  
but when you listen to darnells four letter word vocabulary watch his actions  you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period  much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him  
not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent  this isnt the robin williams we know and love  
whats there to argue about anyway  
in this case  davidson is running from thugs  gets into a subway car as the doors are closing  starts to taunt the thugs  then the doors open back up again  
sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie  not that his performance is bad or anything  its not  but it is sad that hollywood wont use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent  shoot to kill  sneakers   
ive seen this movie already  i said  as i looked at the box art  
what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather  most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips  whose favorite phrase is  its all love   and robin dunne  who plays ciscos stuttering  blackwannabe assistant  
eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout  no matter how putupon she is  we cant feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day  
avoid at all costs  
shadyac also directed the first  ace ventura  movie  
then again  with an ending like this film has  its obvious a sequel is already being considered  
and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones  why dont they wear masks to filter it out  
i am willing to put up with preaching from a film  but the messages here are old hat  
witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance  where is the attitude of  who wants to live forever  when love must die  gone to  
this year its  salome   
and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film  
black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits  which is more that we can say for lazard   
um    anyone have a map handy  
trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat  ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel  
heres hoping that happens in the immediate future  
they agree to give him a ride to the next village  
meanwhile connor develops lukeskywalkerlike powers of laser beam deflection  
  what bothers me even more is that the people who make these bigbudget pictures dont realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves   
when everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides  the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination  and now the premise of being lost in space is complete  
 to make things more depressing  it is constantly raining hard  
rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really  really dopey dimwit  
the witch was a palpable presence in that movie  but we never saw it  we never saw anything  in fact  
with eddie murphy on board  however  you hope for something extra  some kind of spark  
the four friends  along with every woman porters dallied with  all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after  
this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground  despite some good performances from a basically competent cast  
unless you are a fan of the tvseries or love to watch steve martin in action  you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres  
in fact  the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this nearblizzard when a shining sun can be seen  
you betcha  
they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing  
we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre  but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character  
she has perfected these characters in movies such as  the wedding singer  and  most notably   ever after   
it bumped seven films up a notch on my  worst of  1997 movie list  
biebe  russell crowe  has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys  including his new replacement  
our main man is a fellow named steve clark  blandly played by jimmy marsden  
one of the good ones is ryan phillippes surprisingly halfway decent performance  
smelling yet another book deal  gale weathers  courteney cox arquette  comes to the set to investigate and finds her exboyfriend dewey riley  david arquette  acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer  parker posey   the actress playing gale in  stab 3   elsewhere  our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name  
the various misfires include  an alien encounter  a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls  the shooting of a spice girls documentary  a movie producer  george wendt  trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie  nearly all of which  though incredibly far fetched  seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up   a meeting with a pregnant friend  whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends   a boating adventure  a bus race  clubhopping  wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd    even 
the dilemma of hating the  heroes as much as the  villains  makes one wish that the  hand of god would suddenly appear and blast both parties into oblivion  
claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored  which really transfers onto the audience  
the film begins to lose its way  though  when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie  
i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny  
theres the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing  but mainly  the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery  
  end of days  aims to be an apocalyptic thriller  
hes a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and thats what makes him great  
blade squad is loud  
french directors luc besson   la femme nikita   and george sluizer   the vanishing   followed woos lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies  
gary  gal  dove  played by ray winstone  has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain  
the performances are stereotypical and cartoonish  
heck  he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film  
nearly the entire audience was couples  
then  when anne heche kisses harrison ford  they have to kiss  because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie   it will be a vindicated action  because her fianc  e will already have cheated on her   
as does director john boormans latest  
the kids  unfortunately  are not up to the task  
it will show once or twice  and then no one  thankfully  will ever have to hear from it again  
cindy crawford isnt black  is she  
soon  a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message  and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake  theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks  a boating town in north carolina  to find out the specifics of the message  
but celebrity is a failure at the core  unless allens point was to make a selfindulgent movie about himself and his friends  
however  as i wrote at the beginning of this review  it does have the distinction of originality  
he leers and sneers  craning his neck to funny effect  
and he made this film  
  mercury rising  has numerous flaws  but there is one that really stands out  its central plot device is unnecessary  
it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling  
as the movie trods along  we discover shes not only the mostlysilent star of the movie but also the object of every male characters fantasies  and probably every male viewers too   
how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me  arent present day moviegoers beyond being  inspired  by something like that  
after enduring mariah careys film debut  glitter  im reminded of a bit from chris rocks bigger and blacker  
its not that anyones bad here  its that they have nothing to do  
but uma makes the most of her seductive character  getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness  
    
it has to be about telling stories  not marketing them  
i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas  
finally  they meet nadia  joanna pacula  who explains their situation  a computer virus has taken over the ship  
this film has an appropriate bluetoned  washedout look like  payback   which was a much better movie   
we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins  real and imagined  to her therapist  
play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull  but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse  
the humor is spread too thin  and much of the plot is too obvious  as is the acting   
and so on  
virus takes itself seriously  
proof for that can be found even in the realm of lowbudget movies  and one fine example is breakaway  1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring  in  famous figure skater tonya harding  
and everyone knows  if you get to ask the first question  baby youre a star  
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality  and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions  
was okay  
even the bad news bears travelled to tokyo  
the ending of this movie really is terrible  
it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window  
boorman  on the other hand  cannot court such excuses to explain  zardoz   or his followup film  the equally awful  exorcist ii  the heretic    
charlies angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight  
i wish it had been quicker  
look at john sayles lianna  or the interesting and littleseen desert bloom  both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire  
my god  it was actually painful to sit through this little 102 minute long film  
ricky is saved  
their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation  
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others  myself included  would pick seven days in may  
i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman  
barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk  talk and act like a cool  hip high schooler  
i love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them  
r 
the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffanys in which the audience is rooting for some sweet  vulnerable  irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness  
its not entertaining  and its not even a good time passer  
in chain reaction  keanu reeves isnt alone  
theres not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling  
the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich  s  and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement  not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out  apparently present for an invisible audience   
the biggest difference between the original  biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible  whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero  
of course  the same christmas tune thats played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background  while characters continue to build  bonds  among one another by making reference to old  quaint movies or movie stars  
i like it  
as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over  glen or glenda  
neither actor had a great role  but their performances were watchable  
although  star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon  
please raise your hand if that comes as a shock  and i will invite you to my allnight marathon of the bad news bears  major league  angels in the outfield  the mighty ducks  the big green  cool runnings and little giants  
as a teenage sexromp  it is not wild or amusing enough  
what a waste  
theyre obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes  having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big boxoffice holiday season   
the film introduces us two three different characters who  in the beginning  are considered outsiders because theyre not  yet  part of this clique  the new kid  steve  james marsden  dull dull dull dull   whos having trouble at home because he hasnt gotten over his brothers  ethan embry  in quick flashes so you dont recognize him  i did  suicide  the renegade girl  rachel  katie holmes  from  dawsons creek    whos chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring  and by far the most interesting kid  gavin  nick stahl  the kid from  the man without a face    whos the most interesting because hes the only character whos given some dimension  
a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp  
the movie is a medley of clutter  confusion and wrong decisions around every corner  
its about to expire  
for a storyline filled with surprises  its oddly predicable  
in fact  the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing  
at this point i found myself thinking  were supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film

its interesting to note that alex cox  credited as a cowriter on the screenplay  was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over  
but it does  
so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team

based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake  the story is centered on the three  life long amigos  
unfortunately  hes not onscreen enough  
after seeing this film  my opinions have not changed  
the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher  a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey   with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude  who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world  
it continues the story of ripley  the spacetruckerturnedimpromptusurvivalist  but seems remarkably uninterested in her  
  jurassic park iii  will probably provide some quick entertainment for those who go into it knowing what to expect  the same crowd who maybe liked  the lost world  jurassic park

see it if you like to watch really bad movies  otherwise skip it  because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it  
its not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality  but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this  the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex

despite his outward appearance  jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person

martial arts master steven seagal  not to mention director   has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights  talks in a hushed tone  and squints at any sign of danger  
the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music   i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie  and not on the content  
it is interesting to note  that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you  only that one can go to jail

get me a cup of coffee  
unfortunately the concept lends itself to skitlength sequences which would be more at home on the set of  saturday night live  rather than a fulllength feature

she visits her friends apartment monica  harold perrineau jr    who is a crossdresser  blending right into the san francisco scene  
the movie doesnt have the oomph to make it a great movie  and doesnt have the script to make it a funny movie  
it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up

there are some attempts at  characterization   but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction  which puts kaela on edge  yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissyfaces at each other every five minutes  and benj  apparently gay  is in love with the computer  apparently female   
her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was  an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed

with the worlds worst dialogue  cheesiest premise and stupidest editor  this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity  
what seagal doesnt realize is that no one takes his films seriously  although maybe a couple do  and any message he has is no only redundant  but doesnt comfortably fit in his film  which is filled to the brim with hokey violence  crap suspense  stupid melodrama  and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish

im going to start this review off with a hypothetical question  
this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting  the  ordinary person  in question  jakob heym  is played by robin williams  
the action sequences  which include a variety of chases  are occasionally interesting  but never invigorating  
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there  virus still feels very empty  like a movie going for all flash and no substance  
thats not to say that you cant make a decent comedy from that premise  but it is one of american pie 2s undoings  
the movie  then  is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts  who created the original  groundbreaking pc incarnation of  wing commander  back in 1990  
six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the red planet  terraforming to make it more hospitable for future generations  
id seen enough  
its not even worth a 99cent video rental  
kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch  a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her  
fichtners performance doesnt exactly save the film  and its not like im recommending  whats the worst that could happen   
the water rushing towards the land is effective  but once it hits the continent  the effects turn ridiculous  
by default  dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots  but it delivers jerky boys level material  
to be honest  the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes  
their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act  in a last minuteand futileattempt to inject warmth into the material  
if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night  however  id recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else  
little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster  
simmons  however  discovers that his memories are fragmented  his body a creepy mess  and his wife married  
sorvino gives a riveting  touching performance in a banal movie  im tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane   her character is affecting and her emotions truetoheart  
there have been bad films in recent years  mr  
i do give this film stars because of the sets  costumes  and sadly  unmet potential  
moving on  there is val  christina ricci  and stephie   gabby hoffman  2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts  
this search for god takes us nowhere because  as his friend david  reifsnyder  says  where can you look for him if he doesnt exist  
dont be fooled  
the jokes are right out of  mchales navy  and other cutrate sitcoms of the past  
as mr  freeze  arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once  
now the bad guy is  like  stoned  man  so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero  
thusly patch adams isnt a bad film because its about a doctor who cares for his patients  its a bad film because its a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation  
but dont call her  babe   
woody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts  but hes lost here  
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this  
mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film  
the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their outofcontrol libidos  
but having said that  the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the  official  critics  while i  a regular  joblo  in the audience  just wouldnt get what all the fuss was about  
when all is said and done  shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained  
cinematographer allen daviau  but too often favors the films visual presentation over the story hes trying to tell  
in fact  kilmer disappears during the middle of the film  just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting subplot  
needless to say  they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family  
the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted  along with whatever promise the film initially contained  
do some police academy sequel  imagine that   
using this approach  i was right three times and wrong only once  
for some reason  its never crossed anyones mind that the real equation is quality films  more profit  
in fact  its kind of boring  
alas  mickey rourke  we hardly knew ye

i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted

i dont think aniston is a competent enough actress to carry a movie  
i dont know if these phrases are word for word  but theyre close  
julie james  jennifer love hewitt  and ray bronson  freddie prinze jr   are back from the original to star in i still know  reprising their roles in typical fashion

cisco is surprised and says   whoa    lets 
  the ghost in the darkness   which opened a few months ago  is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving  it not only invited my thoughts to divert me  it nearly put me asleep  
while preparing to commit suicide  she encounters drug addict constance  celine bonnier   who causes madeleine to rethink her decision  
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seenlittle awkwardness  and a very clever script  
along with goodman is mathematician harry adams  jackson   biologist beth halperin  stone  and ted fielding  liev schrieber   
then as the movie went on  arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads  twisted sex games  and alien abductions  
its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant  
aykroyd is more loquacious  yet much flatter as elwood  
the script happily womanbashes but also tries to sound like an 80s movie  
whether or not they save the day  i will not reveal

this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie  1976   heathers  1989  and clueless  1995  and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich  s  
aiding aki and dr  sid are the deep eyes  a group of hardasnails types that would have felt at home with the troops in  aliens   
the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible  
me  youll miss the boobs but end your night with some rocksolid porn and its all good  
the story is beyond routine  the script is embarrassing  at one point  this jumbo jet is flying completely upside down   the characters are worthless  and the performances are annoying  
along with being plagued by other ghastly visions  cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party  
he is undependable  meanspirited  and stupid  
but what about the script  
everyone  including long  appears to be going through the motions  
marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous  profane  and stoner friends  plus a recruited hit man     lure bobby to a swamp one night  stab him  beat him over the head with a baseball bat  and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators  presumably  finish him off  
it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love  
if you throw away the plot  which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence  logic  coherence  and consistency  species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience  
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated  beautiful  mysterious  magical and spooky  
every look in jolies eyes screams  psycho   
godzilla has lots of rain and lightning  reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak  blockbuster  juicy fruit  swatch  sprint and bumble bee tuna  
i am a dancer   she screams  but does it in such an over dramatized way that youll start laughing  
the one cityscape shown is a jetsonslike gleaming metropolis  with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting  
he returned to find her dead and was heartbroken  
the seams of lastminute edits to mighty joe young showunrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves  
more specifically  the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf  and for the ghosts that haunt the main character  
this is shallow  unfunny  and pretty annoying to watch  
an attempt at a love triangle  conveyed by ari and the human daena  estella warren   driven   giving each other back off looks over leo  fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them  
most suspiciously  what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun

some are fun to watch and some are actually funny  
when hes not pointing the camera directly at himself  director costner does have a nice visual sense  and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trustnoone 90s  but by the time the second hour rolled around  i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes  
there have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it  
many football fans  including one i attended with  are liable to be disappointed with the ultrastylish way stone has decided to present the game

martin sheens brother joe estevez  whose character looks like he had entered from another movies set  is the only bright spot of breakaway  
catherine zetajones plays virginia baker  an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal  sean connery   
i just expect a man who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative  
whatever morbid appeal the farfetched premise has quickly evaporates  and the selfabsorbed characters  especially cooper  pretty much grate from the getgo  
schneider has a sweetness that makes the clueless but goodhearted deuce believable  
the rest of the cast also fails to add much  but the writing can be faulted for that  
theres the groups unofficial leader  thurgood  david chappelle   scarface  guillermo diaz   brian  jim breuer   and kenny  harland williams   
well  blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie  
the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow  but that simple creative touch couldnt save the rest of this films uninteresting plot movements  
counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other  
an actor might be chosen on the upandup  to give him exposure  or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck  
at least  my best friends wedding  changed the formula a bit and had a somewhat surprise ending

she later meets him as her hubbys new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality  and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel  
the flying inkpots rating system   wait for the video  
this being an action blockbuster  its no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script  which starts off totally confusing  and when some of it is explained  and not much of it is   its utterly ridiculous  
it pounds on your head so forcefully and so unstoppably that  if you are a normal person  you leave feeling sick  
the cops are also upstairs  administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order

capsule  liebes meets tod  
that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes

i didnt get her name  but hopefully my son did   
like anthony hopkins for  legends of the fall   the line  scrooooooo em  has been thus embroidered upon my membrance   
a better question  what would inspire a studio to produce said movie  
why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained  but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot  
even though there is still action going on  
if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet  and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them  youre way ahead of the game  
they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects  embarrassing writing and kidfriendly slapstick  
as is  however  the story and screenplay is a mess  filled with dead laughs  enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as hes performing them  and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well  
the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser  whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt  but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots  while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence  but is strong in accepting her faith

  who are these jedi knights   
in other words 28 days doesnt contribute to the moviemaking business on any level  
unfortunately  the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isnt so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture  but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre  although  to be fair  deep rising is a particularly bad entry   
herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes  
for starters  the film has a major question of identity  
this does look moderately kool  but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling   oooh  look look  
spoiler to follow in the next paragraph  
dont get me wrong  catherine zeta was sweet window dressing  despite my continued perception of her faint mustachesee entrapment   and owen wilson was good as the standard  comic relief   but come on people  if youre going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks  how bout giving them a little more than oneliners as dimension  
summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film  it looks great  it has a few notable performances and i suppose its pretty well directed  in a purely technical way

not that it really matters  since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot  
the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends  
the film  which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states  is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage  and  while its evident that this could be a fascinating live production  the translation to the screen is a creative disaster

based on what the film told me  i gather that steed  fiennes  is some kind of british super guy  somewhat like james bond   and that dr  peel  thurman  is just a really smart doctor  who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits  
why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie  with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know

but truth be told  he is much worse than mediocre  
the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places  however youll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score  which is completely unrelated to john williams classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films golanglobus production   
the only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows  jane march was very cute as jane  and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length

you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review  
the plot involves male cop tinam  simon yam   investigating a series of brutal murders  
and for action buffs  the action scenes are pretty lame  with some really unrealisticlooking special effects  a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub   
gibsons script only adds insult to injury  
while theres no stopping a kid from seeing something that they wantor disney wants them tomost i believe will be disappointed

this turkey is really cheesy  
whats the message i derive from all this  
specifically  shes out to protect joe  a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood  
and truthfully  this is onehundred percent correct  
shes a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france  
cast against type  michael keatons understated menace is highly effective  
that doesnt mean we have to  
about the leads  dammit   and liked the premise behind the film  before i saw the finished product  of course   
booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those overthetop comedies  
the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen  
how to take your bad idea and make things worse  include two or three plot twists that  instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent  make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely  
it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive  
his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him  
move on  
her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hoopers tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in jaws

that very evening  the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter  
edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions  until he meets marla  helena bonham carter   
each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization  
its like they took the subgenre of the disaster pic  which can be fun and hokey at the same time  and then forgot one of the greatest parts of them  the stupid  eccentric characters  
when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed  giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all  what does he do  
christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie  ive never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now  
see it twice  
not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts  but the banal rich girlpoor boy love story is tossed in for good measure  
their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword  
dillon  who was so charming in his understated role in last years in  out  gives the best performance  and murrays surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film  
she imbues serafine with spirit  spunk  and humanity  which gives us an emotional stake in the characters fate  
and depardieu    
one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jeanluc godard film  
oh yeah  ive just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered  but hey  ill crack jokes anyway  
that is because  metro  takes itself seriously  but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun  
carrie genzel plays paris  the vr lover  but ami dolenz  as the current love interest  seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality  which doesnt lend credence to the films premise  
richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel   tienne  guillaume canet  and fran  oise  virginie ledoyen   
right

oh  how i wish you had heard them  
useless triviajoel schumacher loves the vigilante theme  
and dicaprios awful performance doesnt help  
though materialistic in mind  bilkos methods has thoughtfully enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter  providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that  
no one here really acts like a real person  and the story is even further removed from reality  
there are some bright spots  
perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters  
no one seems to care about anything that happens  
though its based on a novel called the invisible man  the title has been ironically changed to hollow man that sums up the film very nicely

men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end  in the final scene  she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum   and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her willmere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned  shes cheerily redecorating his apartment

not bothering to shout nor even get close to them  she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people  
quite frankly  i dont know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through the messenger without a major fumble  
first off  theres her boyfriend  jeremy london  who gave one of the alltime lousy performances in  mallrats   and is only a notch better here   whos a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully  played by nicky katt from  suburbia   who shows hes got that quiet creepiness down pat once again   
take your kids to see boogie nights instead  
let me clear things up for you cupcake  this isnt a bad bmovie  its a really bad bmovie  
the film offers a few funny  albeit juvenile  moments and the onscreen relationship between pinkett smiths woo and tommy davidsons tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two arent forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags  
this is his fourth straight lackluster outing  following last man standing  the fifth element  and the jackal  
the plot involves west and crossdressing government agent artemus gordon  kevin kline   who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists  
one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches  and soon a newlygestated alien is running amuck  
the movie starts with a rather se7enish opening sequence  rather cool and sets the mood for things to come  
ive got reason to believe  you see  i admire a lot of ewan mcgregors previous work    
their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight  especially mccullochs constant thwarting of ferrells attempts to gather information from the girls  who  in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat  so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsys brother   
this sort of got on the nerves after a while  too  
later  she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out  
sure did put me in my place  
its not like this is any kind of original idea  it just throws in some  rosemarys baby   along with  the devils advocate  a little  exorcist  and some  stigmata  here and there  
that particular subplot is so hokey  so predictable  it nigh on ruins the film  
what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart  
chesters fiancee bess  graff  thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position  and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams  
    and if that werent bad enough  theres plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isnt explained at all  
deuce bigalow  male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video  a division of diney   
john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack  
there are individual scenes and ideas that work  i like the thought of a sentient computer program  but none of the films strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree  
when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews  they become convinced that he must have a radio  which is a punishable offense in the ghetto  
for one thing  you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title

we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in maos communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz  samuel l  jackson   who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity  
and the socalled  rollercoaster ride  ensues  
renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless  theres no fun in kicking a wounded dog  is there  
only in the nineties  little red riding hood is a foulmouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon  and the big bad wolf is a serial killer  keifer sutherland   
by the time we actually reach the year 3000  people should still be avoiding this film  
blade  which is based on a marvel comic book character  is  like a comic book  all visual  
also  how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy  sexy jadzia  
his childhood is cruelty and competition  
this review contains spoilers  but believe me  i dont say anything you cant guess 10 minutes into the movie  
the court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable  and not helped by the soppy overacting  
in lucys world  sex and drugs come handinhand  
in the funniest scene  and possibly the only funny scene  of the movie  they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot  
and its all completely predictable  
monumentally underused jolie portrays an empty headed sexpot whose idea of sex revolves around cars and memphis  
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell  
i could say dozens of bad things about him  he way overuses slowmotion  he has no eye for action  he cant get even mediocre performances out of actors  and so on  
the kirbys hired hands  and obvious bait  are a threesome led by mr  udesky  michael jeter   the gift    
somehow  bruckheimer manages to attract top hollywood acting talent to high concept  poorly written movies  gussies up the film with lots of gold hues and pleasingly stylized action and they sell like proverbial hotcakes  
it saddens me even more  then  to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horrorschlock such as bats  
it hardly matters if they are true or not  such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi  he didnt   
then  however  he runs into ed mccracken  bill murray   a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for  well  anything  
were never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions  
the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tillys cleavage to keep attention during the first half  and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half  
the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel  so  two years later  we were subjected to home alone 2  which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited  
there should be some element of satire  
that is her hallmark  
senseless  r  marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian  and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life  
the original cartoon still works  so whats the point   
cast  gary sinise  don cheadle  connie nielsen  jerry oconnell  kim delaney  tim robbins  elise neal  jill teed  jody thompson  bill timoney written by  jim thomas  john thomas and graham yost directed by  brian depalma running time  115 minutes 
he also fears commitment  and despite dating anne  renee zellweger  for over three years  hes unwilling to marry her  
its really a shame that her career hasnt been better since she made this film  
he  like the others  does absolutely nothing unexpected  
and banish this nonsense to where it belongs  
movie sucks  
the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along  
mean  head over heels  
what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such selfassurance in his eyes  you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office  
most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact  either good or bad  that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings  
it eats little boys  
in this movie  theyre both  
finally  the duo get on the road and  along the way  pick up an additional helper a beautiful hustler  played by the gorgeous vanessa angel   
in fact  shouts of  egad  man  what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway   
perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate  
there are some genuinely hilarous moments  one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity  
in moores case  the film would have been helped if  the x files  gillian anderson had been cast instead  especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression  
he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television  does the college lecture circuit  and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film  
ill bet you can  
previously  the most counterfeitlooking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii  
but then again  if they were smart there wouldnt be a movie  
the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow  
humans made this movie  
if youre in the mood for this type of movie  youd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir  
since every character is onedimensionally written  no ones acting abilities are challenged in any way  
after going through the perfunctory motions  jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream  followed by ice skating  
i thought  its about these two cops  
so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy  and the acting is like the siberian steppes  
  dont believe the hype   
theres also the prison guard subplot  
this enlightenment just doesnt prepare him for the mining assignment  
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of  glen or glenda   
another problem was pointed out by my friend  alex  who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout  
but thats par for course  nothing in this film makes any sense  including half of arnold schwarzeneggers lines  
stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldnt look more bored  
they should have brought him along for the entire film  
eve tries to convince her sisters georgia  diane keaton  and maddy  lisa kudrow  that their father is dying and needs them  
but while watching deep impact  i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film  
sadly  mighty joe young wastes them both  
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture  but whatever it was    he 
11   galapagos iguanas actually live in the french polynesian islands  
thats convenient  because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris  you wont believe the films final shot  with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and  rosemarys baby  inspired imagery   
the griswolds are driving down the highway and holiday road  the theme from the original vacation  begins to play  
the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits  
when her girls and her are robbed by turpin  she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit  
party girl annabel  eliza dushku of bring it on  is dating worldweary harvard student matt  wes bentley   
it seems like im reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now  
the fairy godmother standin  leonardo da vinci  patrick godfrey  is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle  
the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movies surprise conclusion  
nostalgia for the 70s continues  as we see a revival of one of the decades greatest achievements  the marijuana comedy  
his oneliners fall flat  and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions  mental and physical  required of his character  
there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film  and in every scene involving them  they are always standing sidebyside  
before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries  
is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing  
the character is poorly written  but reeves gives another charismafree performance  
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases ive ever seen in last years ronin  
the scenes lack any charm  she just gets the job done  
  some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st  bernard for eve to care for   
but what about ruben blades insulting presence as the cop  
years pass  
theres a good  and timely  story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first  a new movie about the abuses of our prison system  
you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice  this would be the result  except here you have such interesting characters as the  token white guy   busey  who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world  the token jive talker named tyrone  charlie barnett  who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word  honkey  as much as possible  the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains  mr  t  a real stretch for him   the aspiring musician waiting for his big break  maher   the mexican gigolo  rodriguez   the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living  warfield  and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living  adam baldwin   
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line  
that such a scene  along with the rest of the movie  was intended to be taken seriously defies comment  
not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem  
and it works as an action film  where it does have a tendency to occasionally go allout  
my respect for supposed  lightweight  action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in  battlefield earth  how badly an action sequence can be shot  
im guessing  and from the available evidence  its not a great guess  that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess  stupidity  ego and powermongering  
there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space  its just that none of them happen to be actors  
real mature  
why do i hate anaconda  
ray liotta is a psychotic serial killer being transported from new york to california on christmas eve  
maddy  georgia  and eve do not see each other much anymore  their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart  but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another  
in an effort to change his image  stallone goes for a yuppie  gq look in the film  wearing spectacles and three piece suits  
i got so restless during this movie  i almost walked out  
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
   a little creaky  but still better than staying at home with gotcha  
he has called it a comedy  a thinking mans picture  a throwback to the old series  and  most grievously  he has likened it to a john ford western  
on top of this  they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters  
but the bloodshed certainly remains  theres enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills  though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness  
etc  
its about overhyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tieins  
such as the oil tanker part      it was   oh no  were going to hit the oil tanker    
smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom  timothy hutton  is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate  
hes got a good eye  and some intriguing visual ideas  if anything  this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery  
if so  they were sadly mistaken  
there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers  
this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood  
to make time pass  the creators have inserted several  refreshing  scientific details  that would not convince a halfcrazed frog  
like terl  the audience felt imprisoned  dreaded their situation  and looked for any opportunity to leave  
i know  but it looks too out of place on screen  too staged  
humour  or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnens mad  sadistic kind  is hard to find  
just say it has very high explosive potential  
someday  youll be forgiven for cutthroat island  which wasnt really your fault in the first place  
well  i ignored rules 3  4 last night  and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards  
only the recognizeable elijah wood  deep impact  is at the front  other than that  the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers  
as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck  
in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen  
overall  a very talented cast virtually wasted  
even more curiously  he seems to be interested in her advances  
didnt the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs  
while with the police  a telegram comes from his wife saying she left him and is going away because she wants to be alone  
who would you guess wins  
wallpaper is separating from walls  
we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track  most notably the  almost  appearance in the film by christopher reeve  
alas  thats not the case  and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio  
remember how stupid that looked  
writer steven e  desouzas fairly straightforward plotline isnt as outre as doubleteams strange yarn involving a secret think tankprison  but it makes about as much sense  which is little  
it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site  apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan  
this led some to believe that battlefield earth would amount to scientologist dogma  laden with subliminal messages  
maybe some stunts  
there are some spectacular shots  especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires  
the last five minutes of this movie are the worst  with some silly celestial nonsense that would be laughed out of any planetarium light show  much less a summer movie  
no one believes him  including his friends and lawyer  
you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts  
any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac  
it is a visual medium  
i did  however  keep track of some of the swearing  
stiles best friend  rosario dawson  is a pot head  prinzes roommate  shawn hatosy  is a girl crazy fool who cant meet women  and then there are the porn stars  zak orth and selma blair   
the one bright spot here is jean reno  who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic  quite unlike what weve seem him do in the past  
her marriage is cold and unfulfilling  
of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties  and meet the ugly aliens themselves  
as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s  i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy  
but goldblum just stands there for about thirty seconds watching  instead of just unplugging the damn thing  
  something is fishy in the state of universal   
the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole    
note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  
in order to woo his lady love serina  louie makes friends with a young boy  sammy  who persuades teacher mrs  hammerbottom  carol burnett  to allow louie to attend class  
it isnt funny the first time  
i think rock is a great comic yet he hasnt been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies  whenever he acts  and no matter the part  its like hes doing the damn chris rock show  
i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line  but it ended up being a setup for nothing  
just dont be too upset if you cant find it  
certainly she had to endure a miserable life  
blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really  really love this kind of music  you might kind of  sort of like this movie  
he hires an adult book store clerk named max california  joaquin phoenix  to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography  
lamberts performance is also good  but even the bigger talent couldnt help this film  destined to end in oblivion  
so looking back  the original didnt hold a lot of great memories for me  since i didnt think too much of it when i initially saw it  
again were presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should  
okay  hes working from a book  so maybe ollies not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas  
martin landau has a great cameo as a classic  hardnosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne  
overall  this movie stinks  
none of these movies ever handle the subject properly  instead introducing the feeble beauty and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love with the guys personality  overlooking his personal appearance  
i suppose i should have seen this coming  
the strength of this film lies in its rational theme  that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol  
it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough  
the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young mollys house and creates every wish she wants  
if only the rest of this formless  aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently  
there isnt much good about this movie  
since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy makeup  
surely nobody could have any problems with that  
janeane garofalo  for example  is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stones part in basic instinct  neither is stone any less talented because she couldnt do garofalos comedic roles  
if anyone working on this movie had an i  q  
of course  in between  and at the end  there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs  
this whole  inner space  notion is never explained  particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world  
that may be because roros background is a lot like that of the director  
if  for some bizarre   twilight zone  type of reason  you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film  my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over  
  special note for trekkies  marina sirtis  the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek  the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife   
the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh  
theres a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen  
im surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film  or that it would make a lot of money at the box office  
he seems dumb and misguided  and his voice never changes tone  
compelling films about sexual crimes dont spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks  and they certainly dont show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture  
finding an allstar cast for such a film is a stroke of genius  
writer andrew kevin walker didnt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for 95s twisted thriller   se7en   
however  it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel  
this got to me  
its not a completely successful film  but as a failure its certainly an interesting  and mostly entertaining  one

the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas  and then to notsodarkest africa  where ace is on the case of a missing white bat  
take one glance at caspers batloathing sidekick jimmy  leon   and youll have immediate deja vu  hes the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie  constructed specifically for timed comic relief  
unless you are a diehard schwartzenegger fan  stay away  
suffice to say that   godzilla  is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade  
worse  actually  
how do they come up with this stuff  
towards the end  palmetto refocuses on plot for the grand finale   a confusing explanation involving impersonators  with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals confession  
ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie  ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next  stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose  
its just a pile of dreck    an 
  was that an actual sequence or a fantasy   
hopefully  liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential  
this film had potential in its tale of oneupmanship  
during the body of the movie  it is undeniably repetitive  never progressing towards a conclusion  
adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better  
we are able to identify with eve  ryan   the most open and caring daughter  because she is the one who stayed by her fathers side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career  
natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality  but she doesnt have too much to work with  either  
although to be fair to cindy  her lines were kinda cheesy in places  
just watch any old bugs bunny short  
and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far  beautiful  this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic  idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast  
if you are in the mood for samurai  read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie  
i know that theres such a good thing as good action  hes called john woo  
the generals daughter is  more often than not  a predictable and unexciting mess  
they even have animals  two by two  ready to climb into the cave  
we can  in some films  fill the textual gaps ourselves  but that almost never happens in an american film  nbsp  
the result  she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max  a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake  camouflage like a chameleon  climb trees like a leopard  and attack with the strength of tiger

as for the claims that the catholic church created  dracula  well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion  outside the fact that priests and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury  with enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame  
its charmless  molassesslow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta  where the real mccoy is set  might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation  
every character  every twist and turn  is stolen from television or from other movies  
the lawyer  kevin lomax  keanu reeves  is not offered a job yet  he is asked to simply pick a jury

something this bad cant help but look even worse  
on a story level  the generals daughter is ineptly constructed  
mel gibson  in yet another disappointing picture   conspiracy theory  and  lethal weapon 4   anyone    stars as the reprehensible villainhero  porter  a man who becomes determined to get his 50 share of 140  000  which he stole in a robbery  back when his partnerincrime  gregg henry  and drugaddicted wife  deborah kara unger  doublecross him  shoot him  and leave him for dead  
considering the huge budget  the all star cast  and a story by crichton  sphere is majorly disappointing  
producer jerry bruckheimer plays upon that attraction with a movie so loaded with testosterone and laced titillatingly with shot after frenetic shot of powerful muscle cars  sleek foreign road huggers and iconic speed machines that many males will leave the theater in an orgasmic haze  
hes not even very cute   
why not  
thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused  being trite  being silly  and being just plain stupid  
he later decks a reindeer  
now what didnt work in this movie  
this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief  incredulous that its being foisted upon the public  
milo oshea  who looks like an irish tom snyder  is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together

the only bad performance in the film is that of leons  
theres a father whos loud and obnoxious  a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his fathers condition by saying  if i were a gambling man id put a lot of money on death   
she certainly went beyond the call of duty  she has to kiss carrot top       
the rest of the performances are wasted  
  jawbreaker  is a pastiche  and not even an enjoyable one  
i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie    
such escape should become necessity  because the warden poe  kurtwood smith  begins showing unhealthy interest in karen  
in fact  i am sure that more time was spent gathering the  hits  for the soundtrack of this film  than were on the socalled  screenplay   
such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following  the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie  
her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar  and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls  
i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good  in this film they overact in most of their scenes  
is it the screenwriter  don macpherson  
let me spoil the final scene  farmer hoggett looks at pig  proud  says  thatll do  pig  
this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sants universally panned update of psycho  i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience  but also very onpar with an original  
the setonatrain climax looks good  even though the action is illogical   and the beautiful  crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor  
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film  i picture a room full of monkeys  
but its not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike  played by elizabeth berkley  still trying to jumpstart her career after  showgirls    
has he no more assassins  
one exciting scene is a credit  and the only part remotely worth seeing  to the film  in which an alien chases two men  one a cripple  up a tall ladder with interesting results  
a stranger among us  1992 ripoff of peter weirs witness  belongs to the latter category  
i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film  with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius  spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade

the psychlos are after mining earths precious resources  but for 1  000 years are unaware of fort knox

all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie  
the cheese factor is only increased when hes involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist  geneticist  zoologist  whateverthef   kshessupposedtobe whom he befriends  
eddie isnt just a bad movie with a formulaic premise  
excuse me  again  while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion  
all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend  i miss my son   
kevin costner has never looked worse  
tvs buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in  simply irresistible   
i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively  the best known of those would have to be star trek

it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them  
williams  once a  cant miss  prospect in hollywood  has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising  and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career  
 script has a lot of holes  
it pretends it is something that it is not  a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a hightech thriller  
meanwhile  theodore valentine  larry dann  is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her  
although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea  its ruined by poor execution  
seen the film  
i kept thinking to myself  with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture  
even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one  
gold bond  to a state home  where we find out hes a different from the other kids  
that movie featured copious sex  a pair of real characters  and a powerful script  
it may not be my cup of tea  but at least it is a noble ambition  
now how or why mr  bean is sent on this trip makes no sense  and i cant even describe how the film explains it  
whats funny is that if you watch gangster movies made  in  japan  there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics  but of course theres no room in this movie for any of that  
thats when you know your healths failing  
riiiiight  
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage  only to turn up the next day  ready for work  
its silly and pretentious filmmaking  but at least it provides a giggle or five  
shes thrilled  but nevertheless spends a few days at pauls to recuperate  the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play   cabaret    and just when pauls got in his head that shes starting to love him back in that nonfriendly way  she decides to become alcotts livein girlfriend  
i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately  since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood  
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailera trailer for a movie written by a team of bodybuilders and greeting card authorsive never been a prouder wimp my whole life  
but enough about the phony snakes  
the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus  who was also behind camera in martin scorseses brilliant  goodfellas    is absolutely stunning  
the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine  
youll see 60 of anastasia there  
after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech  the movie introduces us to two consultants  john c  mcginley and paul willson  which are in charge of  downsizing  the companys payroll  
at the top of the list is ritchie  
fields  
it seems that with such bad luck  he wouldnt want to make another movie set near water  but here he is again with one of the main  and most ridiculous  centerpieces set on a stormswept sea  
too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition  
one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space  because no extra on the tv show ever lives  as proven in the star trek series

verlaine talking with rimbauds sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses  which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published  
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film  but instead  he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes  
2  there was a documentary made in 1998  wrestling with shadows  that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation  vince mcmahons screwing bret  the hitman  hart out of the title  
a complete waste of time  this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies  
deep rising meets these two requirements part way  but not enough to salvage the film  
the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that youll be laughing more than youll be screaming  
yeah  me too   
the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish  
there are no shoes with only feet in them  no limbs scattered everywhere  no torsos without limbs  no charred corpses  and most importantly  all corpses have heads  in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds   
but rehash old plot lines  tired dialogue  and standard clich  s  and a wellintentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film  
hanging up has the overall effect of a telemarketer pestering you for two hours  while you dont have the option of doing as the title suggests

we are supposed to care about alessas feelings  but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father  
brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a bigheaded mogul who after a while became routine and old  
while the game had nonstop fighting sequences  this movie is a hodgepodge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time  
consider another punch pulled  
bottom line  dont get trapped in this one  
if someone breaks the rules enough  he or she is aged to the point of senility  and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals  
i liked the music  but dont bother buying the soundtrack  
james bond  
nothing but groans and yawns  
or  as one audience member succinctly summed it up   whoa    
without him  sgt  
at least her marion crane has a little life in her  which cant be said for most of the rest of the cast  
first of all  some of the reviews were fairly positive  
the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead womans sister  
chapter headings that divide the movie have no function  
the film takes place in our future  when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesnt appear to have intelligence  
this seems to be more of a visual film  
despite an american r rating  which the content does not justify   the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset  
there are a few bright moments  but they are far and few between  
krippendorfs tribe will quickly become extinct  
all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen  
carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties  
in the course of the 102minute running time of  payback   porter is shot three times in the back  hit by a van  beaten up  and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer  
this is possibly the years best intense action film  or at least  one  of the best  
handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work  
if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was  try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements  
  
william hurt is perfectly cast as the worldweary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city  
what makes it even worse is eszterhas insistence upon telling every bad joke not once  but twice or even three times  
when will robinson  jack johnson  teaches his pet robot about friendship  you are actually supposed to buy it  
there  s nothing quite like a gory anime  
the new kid  alex pruitt  is played by alex d  linz  one fine day   and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness  
the apes city resembles a dank complex of tree houses  
i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie  
the first species was a moderatelysuccessful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects  a few well paced action sequences  and frequent views of modelturnedactress natasha henstridge sans clothing  
on that note  how many chinatown cop movies have you seen  
its not a bad thing to update old stories  
based on jim schutzes novelization of a truelife event   bully  charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who  in 1993  murdered their high school bully in cold  calculated blood  
hills and mgms actions were prudent  
he walks  talks  flies  fries  and even fakes his own death  all with the help of 96 computeraided animators  
tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf  theres no spirit  no gusto to the character  
oh  and in keeping with the matchmakers utter predictability  he dies toward the end  
monica  played by martha plimpton is having a huge new years party  
its great  
neither is frank langella  and none of the athleteactors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of  
it doesnt much matter and believe me by the time  shattered image  runs its painful and pedestrian course you wont care  
too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot  and to break down each scene before it was even completed  
i cant recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota  
  supernova  is pretty awful  but im cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got  
in vegas vacation clark griswold  chase  decides to take the family on vacation to las vegas so that he and wife ellen  dangelo  can renew their wedding vows  
boy  are these bats ugly  
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole  however  and the film has become well respected in cinema history  
when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love  the experience is somewhat different  
mitch and sam need 50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients  
its not porters singlemindedness that robs the film of snap  crackle  and pop  as a character who has already  died  once  he has nothing to lose and so much to gain  
there isnt a common theme running through the proceedings  thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless  
where are plot continuity and character development when you need them  
lets just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isnt hurt by the negativity this film is generating  
this is the bulk of the film folks  guys riding from house to house  one keeps getting out to have sex  while the others sit in the car  
anyway  it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there  
starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king  the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics  but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing publicparticularly kids wanted to see  
where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy  eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves character is never given the time to develop  
its a party three years earlier  with the same group of students  
its just the rest of the movie the other hundred or so minutes thats pure nonsense  
the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen  lope cruz  who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations  the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot  but who cant get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story  
but after a fateful encounter with a water well  arthur hogget  james cromwell  who the movie could have used alot more of  has been rendered bedridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially  
  the  not meeting god  part still irks at me  but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect   
to fight the spell  she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall  dark and handsome vampire hunter  you guessed it  his name is d   
were supposed to empathize with shandlings discovery of the feeling of  guilt   but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing  
theron  so good in devils advocate  and paxton  so good in the recent a simple plan  are fine actors  but not fine enough to transcend the material  a paintbynumbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising  
simply update the action to a modern setting  and apply plenty of modern rock  
my breaking point was near the end of the picture  as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters  in the background  we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky  and i wanted that to go away  
thats fine  
to be fair  the movie does contain a few good scenes  all of which you can see in the trailers  
her character is the only one that is at least half written and she could really have done better  
who could fight and jump in a skimpy  strapless leather top  and yet keep her breasts from spilling out  
as summer movies evolve  or devolve  character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing  
a darn good one  but still an 80 minutelong idea  
the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us  none of them register as realistic  interesting characters  they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue  
the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves  
sadly  though  the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of home alone style violence from the ghost of christmas present  played by carol kane  
the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful  
in mollys search for her parents  she somehow falls in love with lillys paparazzo joey  danny nucci   
kelsey grammer is good in this  he just doesnt have anything to work with  
house on haunted hill  i suspect  has just about left the secondrun theaters  
people were getting so fed up they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen  
in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off  
and some with better plot lines too  
well  keanu and rachel didnt hit it off well on the screen  and most unfortunately  morgan freeman doesnt help much either  
theater in real life is engrossing  
even after that happens  though  ill still consider  me  myself  irene  to be a highcaliber misfire  
evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later  when powers was out of the picture  
and when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why  youll wish you never sat through this movie at all  
he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop  
although the print made it  the assistants luggage was lost  
as we meet the characters headed towards the party  we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal  and not interesting at all  
the lesbian kisses cant hold a candle to those in bound  
instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze  since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television  albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the 80s than the 00s   the film simply uses bettys delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b  no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation  
still  its entertaining right up to the end  certainly barrymores incredibly hammy performance  which  nonetheless  works  perhaps due to the silent screen  is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells  bakkers  and robertses of the religious worlds  
jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective  
if you think it might be for you  then by all means seek it out  
with change on all fronts accelerating more and more  nostalgia appears to have a great appeal  but dont you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past  
chambers is good  but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker  
  sunderland actually asks brenner   why was she killed   
a very dangerous liaison  
the plan begins to take shape  but kerseys actions bring attention of two police detectives  reiner  george dickerson  and nozaki  soon teckoh   
youll be the wiser for it  
time passes  
were introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people  
he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any indepth information  
this film  in a way akin to films such as  a few good men   has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism  
youll feel much better afterwards  
i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films  
first  i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs  danvers  the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcocks truly terrifying  rebecca  that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley  
so what if no one finds happiness  these characters dont deserve it anyway  especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time  
luckily  the simpleminded events pick up steam  particularly with the wellchoreographed wrestling action  
no followup whatsoever  so whats the significance  
posh  who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions  comes off best by default because her persona  rich bitch  most easily translates into character in a film  
they both start off with interesting premises  only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through  
instead  it just dangles limply on the branch for a while  withers  and falls away  
wexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive  it combines stereotyped slavetalk   yessuh  massuh    stereotyped southern white trash talk   fer whutre you gittin outta bed     and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk   if you see me hang  you gonna know you killed a black brother     
the concept was brilliant  
this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young  a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film  
qu ying  the films female lead  was also on hand to give a few comments  
synopsis  eccentric millionaire price offers 1  000  000 to each of his guests who appear at a gathering at a former sanitarium  
the scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the bgrade category  
what a mess  
acting doesnt get much worse than her turn as brodericks exflame  
the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays  especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead  
he vowed to have vengeance  
all of which underscores how billy crystal and cowriter peter tolan screwed up their own premise  the comedy in  americas sweethearts  is based on barelyincontrol people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters  except that it doesnt matter because any publicity is good publicity  
by about the twohour mark i felt the same way  
in other words  a mess  
its not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie  despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious  allbutscreaming   look  
george is in between them  
the central role of matty  a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction  is played by matthew modine  who takes what he can get after cutthroat island   
i enjoyed the portrayal of the network of  runners  sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery  
in the end  deep impact is a wasted opportunity  
  the script by de palma and lost worlds david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level and the noise  
who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out  
the villains goals are noble ones  freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit  in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees   so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife  vendela   dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation  and ivys intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth  albeit by destroying all human life  
but as the trailer goes   there is one thing mitch weaver is good atrevenge   
far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly  like the shudderinducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortunehunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church  
she plays billie frank who  despite being abandoned by her singeralcoholic mother  valerie pettiford   believes shes destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is  
we see a beating heart  inflating lungs  and veins pulsing with newlypumped blood  
which one is the killer  
at the top of his lungs  referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle  
perhaps  if the film were content to focus on such reflective  inward moments  leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings  it might have been ambiguous  suggestive  insinuating  
the cool atmosphere is still there this time around  but i just didnt like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one

the film is divided into two sections  
they were as happy a group of men as ive ever encountered  
question  its obvious the babies are supersmart  but why are they able to fight like jackie chan

there are basically two memorable sequences  one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room  a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense  suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room   the second involves a highspeed train  a helicopter  and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved

that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled   
this is an annoying and ineffective device  
i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept its head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson  
this is screenwriting  
this is the biggest disappointment of the year  especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this  
although thats almost expected for lack of continuous screen time  the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories  
robert towne  the screenwriter  who contributed to the first  mission   who is noted for doing  chinatown   writes a colorless  pedestrian script  one that fails even to be funny in a camp way  
the only real story  if you can call it that  was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper  bill murray  who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course  
mr  schumacher is a good director

capsule review  this is what feelgood family entertainment has morphed into in the 90s  an hourandahalf commercial  disguised as an unnecessary remake  in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass  
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy   
its crude and stereotypical  
this leaves them at loose ends  
he enters the photographers stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera  and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend  stella  belinda becker   
so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely overthought  the plot has certainly been done before  generally speaking   the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot  and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones  who if he had some more screentime  could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating  in my book  anyway  
a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner  and would have saved us from the booksellers boring pursuit during the first half  
as ive already mentioned  an entire section of the film doesnt jibe with the rest  and the characterization only adds to the difficulty  
of course  she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers  
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars  
there has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with  
had this movie been made in the 80s  it would have been groundbreaking  
one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell  
worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie  
and better stuff too  
trust me on this one  no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg  and i dont mean steve  invented the printing press  
jones is always wonderful as an authority figure  and hes certainly familiar with this sort of role  as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals   
the plot itself never straightens out  
matthew pointed out that it  is not as good as it could have been or should have been   
amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness  from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger  though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish  
the action scenes should be electric  because this is an action film  
keep this fact in mind  cage is trusted with an important case  which he solves  
in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model  in the movie   which only functions as a supposed comic relief  by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines   and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie  
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we dont see is more frightening than what we do  especially when its a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered   
something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals  
toward the end of the night  they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie  sarah lassez   start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene  then matty thankfully blacks out  
admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film  but theres no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever  
first lets start david gurian who played harris  the manager of the band  
and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a weddingneeding fiancee  
critique  this movie did not make me laugh once  
those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star  
he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques  but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience  and i quickly got bored  
despite its exploitative nature   mandingo  was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery  
the soundtrack is full of 1980s tunes  ranging from  i want candy  to  tainted love   
starship troopers has a bad script  bad acting  and a  plot  that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore  
  jawbreaker  is a monumental waste of effort and resources  and quite likely one of the single worst films ive ever seen  
from the poorlywritten characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the grossout shots  it was a bad effort through and through  
the computergenerated werewolves look painfully unreal  
when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her  the ratings go up and hes hired as a regular on the show  
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties  
just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids  
im going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph  so if you want a review devoid of spoilers  skip onto the next one  
delpys previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowskis white and richard linklaters before sunrise  
stan laurel  for example  was so innocent in all his troublemaking that we were immediately fond of him  
the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as  the subway  at a restaurant  or on the phone  
but lets face it  
both characters are protagonists  but its hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place  and in some cases  simply unappealing

hush has three very simple problems  its incredibly dumb  its incredibly boring  and its incredibly predictable  at least up to the stupefying ending   
just take a look at the fullpage ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes  
sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has  hip comedy  written all over it  compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction  compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits  compensate for clich  d characterizations  compensate for embarrassing  you have to be joking  situations  
all of which gets old after about an hour  at which point i recommend leaving  
tim roth effectively plays the cocky villain  much like his roles in  the cook  the thief  his wife and her lover  and  rob roy   
quite frankly  i dont see the appeal  so when a director shows me a pointofview shot of a junkie  complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices  i am left somewhat unimpressed  
  showgirls  is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene  and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter

hes nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore  not that it was much of one  
rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters  but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance  
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hilari  
and then  as a climax  he took out his video camera and pressed the  on  button  
in some ways  its difficult to judge this film  
he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it  
yes  he even outdoes his own work in raw  
the story revolving around john  meanwhile  is extemely thin throughout  particularly for its 104minute running time  and it alternates between uninspired comic relief  as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club  and heavyhanded melodrama  
get set for stock fishoutofwater situations when cityboy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community  or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking  striptease and unchristian neighboursocking  
townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued  
there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets  
of course  and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way  he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison  
the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie  for these reasons  
they encounter another ship  
and in no looking back  he stumbles  making a slow  boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work

georgina cates  
the direction by john boorman  is that of a confused  stylish nature that i really couldnt figure out  
when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called  an alan smithee film   which  of course  it already is  smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it  
one incredible good reason  
when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water  it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it  even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees

mind you  i wont go as far as to say that its the  worst movie of the year   remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr  movies also    but its definitely the worst film that ive seen during this summer movie season  of course  its still early and im sure there are a few more garbage heaps coming down the pike

his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving  thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman  and 1997s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love  luv  thats even more of a hoot on repeated viewings  
marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer  
thankfully gabriels performance gave some light to this poor film  
well  batman  robin kicked this movies sorry butt  people  
the drama scenes are  quite frankly  boring  and the action scenes suffer from overkill  with levison throwing the camera all over the place  much like the godawful speed 2  1997  
a movie like this is especially frustrating because were not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life  
also unwise is the jolie framing sequence  which practically gives away the films denouement  
no matter how antiquated it might be  theres no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing  
in addition to liotta and hewitt  the cast includes sigourney weaver  gene hackman  jason lee  nora dunn and anne bancroft  
they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers

franks body is invaded by thrax  a lethal virus  after frank eats a hardboiled egg that had fallen to the ground  
and thats supposed to be ok because  see  its a true story  
for everyone else  its not only a waste of time  but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage  
scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism  but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead  
leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment

verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care  
or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have  like jim carrey did with the recent truman show  
horror films should at least exploit violence  but this one is shockingly timid  
at other times  objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot  
scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor  and it is not because the wayans brothers  shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera  dont try  
and spawn himself isnt even an interesting character  
i love the guy  
junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman

sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal  
why did the actors sign up for this  
always one step ahead of the characters  the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the triedandtrue hollywood melodrama  the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing  
the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as  alien  lite  
the final exchange between henstridge and  er  cube though is both audible  and  priceless

synopsis  an aging master art thief  his supplier  and a young  buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be  or are they   in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium  
the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it  comedy

overall rating review by david wilcock  1998 
fooling around  deuce sets fire to the kitchen and smashes a 6000 fish tank  
despite being set in heaven  what dreams may come is mightily depressing  
only one thing  
with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes  
  the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever   
deleted scenes  
well if you are  than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half    only to make up and hug in the end  
the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesnt pop up until near the end of the sequence  
get carter is a simple story  
incidentally  if you appreciated along came a spider  you will likely enjoy this film as well  
fresh from their first year of college the quartet  along with the obnoxious stifler  seann william scott   rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score  
lets stop and think about this for a second  
that really ruined it  however  and thats too bad  
the dialog is    lets face it  its pretty bad  
do i care what lucy and kevin are going through   
with a combination of no tension  drama  or decent characters  a perfect murder is a failure all round  and an incredible disappointment  
events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked  where only one survives  guess who it invariably always is and youll guess the conclusion to this turkey   
amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith  and neil diamond plays neil diamond  hes better at singing than acting   
huston is enjoyable in her overthetop wickedness  
a tv newswoman  diana  gabrielle fitzpatrick   covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo  richard norton  and a local gang of toughs  the demons

his remaining two films  mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience  
to make a long story short  the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short  
but while the characters  places and events may have special meaning to the writerdirector  the audience is left in the dark  
there is a moment early in the film where van orton  realizing his game has begun  smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out whos in on the whole thing  
as we all know  three of the hottest females on the planet  drew barrymore  cameron diaz  and lucy liu  are three superagents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie

in between all the confessionals  cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial  with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning  
the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing  a person for the audience to relate to or admire  
the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk  whos just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation  let me put it this way   he explains  i never saw et   
his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated  not that his writing here is especially good   
the team goes back to jeffreys house  a creepy old civil warera warehouse in the heart of the woods  to regroup and review the tapes  
did it just feel like that  
after a barbecue gettogether for the astronauts  we cut to luc goddard  don cheadle  and his team  who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet  
i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film  
the first problem is a flaw in the plot  
im sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements  
the demons are not  however  the good guys

i also liked michael moores perverted cousin character  and i loved  and i say it again  loved the character that bill pullman played  
his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many recordbreaking feats  much to the dismay of cocky counterpart  mission commander captain overbeck  william sadler   who once held the records  
flubber  as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect  
join the club  were all jealous of jack webbs way with women  which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene  as webb finds his way to the womans place of employment  a lingerie store  and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display  
beyond an ability to use skindiving gear  no special talents are required of him  
its as if director mimi leder didnt have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended  and compromised out of fear that her film wasnt  gutsy  enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for  
theres a giant squid attack in the picture  but not once does the audience see the squid  even though the film has a massive budget  
in our modern world  where the cool rule  its hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming the man  
on that level  the main roles are played by virtual unknowns  
that seems strange  since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about  
sadly for bronson  that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead  and lowering his own reputation in process

jagger didnt have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson  
this film forgets to satirize its characters  and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes    and 
admittedly  i did laugh once in the film  and thats when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum

david thewlis has a part as a drifting conman  
face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movies poster  but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra  attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster  
thats pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow  
by making explicit  what the television show left implicit  carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill  
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair  joe pantoliano  sporting long hair and cowboy boots  has other plans  
l  i  e  would have worked best as a halfhour short film about howies illadvised foray into big johns haven  
i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times  
for the first halfhour  the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development  
i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves  and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sexcrazed buffoons  
i loathed  theres something about mary   yet loved  baseketball   
but like i said  i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities and how hard it is for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization

first off  who hasnt had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre  
often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films and wait for the video  
its a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere  a film that wont allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous  
and yet  its based on a real man who probably has a good point to make

what kind of movie was he trying to make  anyway  
the movie makes several attempts at risquenessmostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons charactersbut they seem almost forced  as if they have to live up to a pg rating  
another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy  played by goldie hawns daughter  and jack  played by jay mohr  
wrong  
rarely  though  is a romantic comedy as cheap  as obvious  or as pointless as serendipity  a film that uses its  theme  as an excuse for its plot contrivances

judging only by the plot   mandingo  is pure sexploitation  
if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie  look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters mother pat  
his character is introduced as a smug genius  the kind whos always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear  sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place  though once the character becomes invisible  this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster

i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999  
were still here  
the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summers other comic book adaptation  batman and robin  
john leguizamo almost makes it as clown  but not quite  
jack is in even worse shape than harry  
it also jumps on the everpopular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there  too  
chuckles were few and far between  and they mostly dealt with visual jokes  such as an old  beaten up horse from  rentawreck   then from any dialogue whatsoever  
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film  
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   glitter  is a pathetic 1  
computer generated  
what we need is a batman  a luke skywalker  
several of the towns leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman  
something along those lines  
the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard  
godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day  so it has a lot of dumb action scenes  destructive special effects and shallow subplots  
john murdoch  rufus sewell  awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel  only to find out he has forgotten everything  
then  as soon as they go to their first hit  it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere  
one entry was definitely enough  and im surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2  this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released directtovideo  
as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie  
theyre more like socially depraved militia men  melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage  including missile launchers and handheld machineguns   
john ritter stars as zach  a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a bigtime drinking problem  
also  travoltas acts with a sort of phony upperclass snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world  
she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do  not to her  but to kiefer  
aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic  its an embarrassment to the cast  and its embarrassing to the science fiction genre  
those who have been disappointed by carreys more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him overacting to the best of his ability  but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesnt capture the feel of the original  
fabulous  
now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene  the filmmakers arent quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil  
the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances  
i have not read the play  or seen the oscar winning  1956 film adaption  but from what i can tell  the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play  for the king and i is never magical  nor interesting  
yet  the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters  
and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double ds  you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet  
snorkle   sniff   hiccup  
and steve buscemi goes crazy and starts shooting at people   
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene  running in slow motion  complete with dialogue from the present  just in case we dont comprehend the link to the past  
the followup to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie  
office  
turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instincts artistic failure  for they work together to make the dumbest  most clicheridden environment in which their characters are to live  and they do so by means of brainless subplots  
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didnt occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film  
the stars deserved better  and so did the audience  
why  they set up a protracted  cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall  of course  
but  sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons  
supergirl  a spinoff film of sorts from the series same producers  alexander and ilya salkind   doesnt even rival superman iii in terms of quality  let alone superman or superman ii  
alley is absolutely unwatchable  and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade  which  i inform you  was total b  s    
good actors should sign to good scripts  and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash  they least they could do is assume that wed like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents  
a big  fat and expensive clich   
  we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us   
the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore  
hodges  whose wounds make him unfit for action  gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer  
a lot of film seems to be used up  
spillane never once described hammers physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared  so any actor could conceivably portray him  
when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character  she turns it into three  always putting strong emotion and power into her roles  
the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoos nest had  
the idea is that death  given the pen name of joe black  so as not to disturb others  wants to take a holiday and experience the world  
the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers dont fare much better  
take payback  for example  a movie that most people seem to like  
subtlety  
a   rating would be far too generous  
along the way writerdirector darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own  
the setup shows promise  but the story never takes off  due in large part to horta and the director  the aptly named jamie blanks  who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares  
unless of course  you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house  
realising that her life suddenly became worthless  myra starts running for her life  followed by professional assassins  
which is what makes this review an even harder one to write  since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold  mess with your head and such  lost highway  memento   but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films  and these folks just didnt snag this one correctly  
hackman  also lowkey  is believable but lacks sparkle  
if it was a couch  youd put it out on the sidewalk  where it would sit for a week  
its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles

  mission impossible    lost in space    godzilla    zorro   
ms  dinsmoor here  anne bancroft   
trust me when i say that its a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through  
at times  the humor in go is sickly funny  and on a low night  almost watchable  but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers  this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night

my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl  alicia silverstone  gets in a race with motorcycle thugs  during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her  
taking even adolescent hormone surges into account  surely this chickenbashing bit is a bit excessive  especially for prim puritan sensibilities

leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo  paul giamatti  who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari  helena bonham carter

there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status  but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention  
tom sizemore and scenestealer don cheadle are both fine  
stripped of the element of surprise  the film was put to the task of showing what it really had  instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion

of course  his best film was 1978s masterpiece   halloween   but he also made 1980s  the fog   and 1987s underrated   prince of darkness   
as it is   spawn  is just awful  it stinks worse than a dead trout  
without saying a word  he is easily the most charismatic person in the movie  
gwyneth paltrow  who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors  is simply awful here  
either way  i dont give a rats ass because this movie is a dog and thats unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it  
from the outset its easy to see why some of the larger  more reputable chains arent carrying it  the film looks like a straighttovideo release from the early 80s thats been dusted off  not very carefully  and reissued in theatrical format  
thats basically the entire plot  
the sense of deja vu was overwhelming  
what is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made  
it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on  coffee talk  sans dress and wig  
as a result  we are saddled with an idiotic good guysbad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had

he turns out to have a colorful father  paul newman  but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing

the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable  especially paltrow  
one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other  
its fine to mix genres  if the film makers know what theyre doing  
heres a hint  it involves lots of water  electrical equipment  a special effect from  the abyss  and the tots who doubled up as adam sandlers costar in  big daddy   
illconceived exploitive project  a pyrotechnical film  
these scenes are not the least bit powerful  on the contrary  theyre intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain  whomever that may turn out to be  
burtons predominant themes of rejection  isolation  and the search for ones place in the universe  as seen in ed wood  edward scissorshands  and peewees big adventure  are completely absent in this planet

its not whining about how awful parents are  and purposely feeling dispondent  
well let me be the first to say  and so far in my view its safe to say  battlefield  earth might be the worst film i have ever seen  yes even worse than  mr  magoo    blue in the face   or  jaws  the revenge

returns to its documentary style  but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone  
and these guys dont just trash hotel rooms  they rape them  humiliate them and leave them for dead  
she can hypotheitically act  we all saw that in  clueless   but her lines kinda sound weird  
the script for the jackal isnt ripped straight from todays headlines  
in typical sketchcomedy tradition  each actor plays several roles  
for instance  charles kalecki  alan king   a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book  turns into a suave mob boss  
it doesnt even matter that eszterhas tags  penile implant  after his own name when he makes a cameo  because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign selfdeprecation  
its not for lack of trying  
the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities  
thats another great epa asset  teaching agents how to fix porches  
its a slobbering psychopath  of course  but this time theres a twist

in seeming answer to their idle daydreams  a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be  
the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers  however  has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up  but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their bloodsoaked honeymoon  
revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies  and they seemed like it  
shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird  it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck  
but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations  
its enough to melt the most callous heart  
yes  the characters do speak  but they do not talk  
the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets  
in fact  young einstein might have been more at home on network television  where its sophomoric humor wouldnt raise any eyebrows  
its fastpaced and entertaining  if youve got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor  
at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive  but it doesnt stay that way  
if you see the film and you find youre not laughing  there is nothing wrong with you  
woody allen has made a couple lessthan good films  and hes my favorite  
thats right  
unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police  hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment  
from minute one to minute ninetyseven  theres hardly a moment when the wavering  skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music dont undercut the action  the notes stricken both overwhelm  particularly john turturro  portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio  whose money and reputation catch lolas interest  and accompany  oftentimes  the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the films characters and reinforce that state   
and yes that is as complex as this movies observations get  
the only thing that kept me awake  was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the films supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way  
i couldnt make this up if i tried  folks  
thompsons book  besides being a hilarious read  has stood the test of time as an important historical document  
cronenberg fans however   those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film  should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you  
unfortunately  problems with this film start with inadequate casting  rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney  while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie odonnell  
equally tenuous is its other running joke  which involves one of his friends  guy torry  who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because hes black  
we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives  
i couldnt take it anymore  
when i arrived in paris in june  1992  i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks  fire walk with me  since the movie wasnt scheduled to open in the u  s  until late august  
with an expressionchallenged cast   final fantasy  mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit  
i guess ol nic  pete  and jim were promised a mountain of money    or 
on another level  the film wants to be a slapstick comedy  and there are many hints of this throughout  
there can be only one  
aside from all the injokes  the story falls far short of compelling  and the characters are all empty and lifeless  
it is cornball sitcom stuff  but  at least  it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director  
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute  a free clinic  
the choppy dialogue and bad directing dont help things any  
it stars mark hamill  luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy  
he found himself in a similar situation in  the replacements   where he was also the only comic talent in an ensemble cast  
who knows if  spawn  the video game  wasnt part of the plan from the beginning  
  yawns ensue

he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth  but misses  
freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood  
it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment  
remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie  
because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan  
ill elaborate further  
though his lightninglit appearances ellicited muchneeded laughter in the theater  his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film  and thats  really  saying something  
she delivers the line so ridiculously that one cant help but laugh  
unsuccessful  not entirely  
perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this  so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements  like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours

drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter  only its very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters  
there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore  
  
plot  a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth  oops    i 
the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does  as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps  who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing  hungry for their 15minutes of fame  
yup those pretty much describe  end of days   
however  if gal says  no  don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guys exporn star wife deedee  amanda redman   
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point  the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title  
believe it  
so is  original sin  really all that bad  
2  3  and 4  
theyre problematic because theyre jarring and distracting  introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldnt have been about cutesy relationships  
these are the most exciting scenes in the film  and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film  
ha ha ha ha    
im not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slowmotion  doubleexposure  and extreme closeups  whoaaaaaa       other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and  yes  he has been to film school  
the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price  an homage to victor price who starred in the original   
but in that case i suggest that you rent a porn film in your local video store  and not waste time surviving through eszterhas pathetic dialogue  
all the while  the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight

its not until club owner silk  rapper dmx   bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends  
the  initial  premise is pretty good and is played  for a while  at a delightfully dizzying clip  
and i think you know what those two things are  
why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends  
christopher walken plays doyles brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of softspoken psychos  and there isnt another single character whom makes even the slightest impression  
i see that youre hiding    from what   
sadly  they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer  
i have a confession  
but i know thats bunkyoure going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say  
although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster  sela ward   an exec of sorts  he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black  neve campbell   and thus the boring romance subplot thats all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film  
for now  i just hope that for his sake  the films title isnt a premonition of the movies ultimate fate at the boxoffice

perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness  or maybe the lack of sadness  together  but the movies denouement was not convincing  
here is where the film took a wrong turn  
hoffman is on autopilot  and almost seems embarrassed  throughout the movie  churning out dull lines  and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie  
the script is 100 recycled  the direction is hokey  and the acting is absolutely horrible  
i dont like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question  
the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here  but anderson seemed to care about them  
and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well  
in a cameo  pam grier plays detective vera cruz  who investigates lizs murder  
instead of editing this scene  more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr  furious  ben stiller  and monica  a waitress  claire forlani  or the vast majority of the film  which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was  
from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles  
however  hes rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo  paul giamatti   duets    
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good  
just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with  
like virtually everything else in the film  its a missed opportunity  
      perfection  
yes  
of course  the rival wants control of his new personal identification system  which involves such latterday buzzwords as gps  cellular tracking  and even mainframe  
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them  
  flubber  straps him in a straitjacket  covers him with duct tape  stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesnt get out  
like i said  the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride  no matter how small  
what they really need is a reality check  
however  the action in  tomb raider  shows little style or originality  
with ivan reitman as director  bill murray as star and harold ramis as costar and coscreenwriter  it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army  
the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale  
like karen disarming one of schmidts henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing  
he plays dylan ramsey  the sweet main character  to the best of his abilities  
i dont think iguanas have a habit of migrating

wh  are there lots of yuks in this one  
as a result  the women proceed to chase him around the city  in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off  
the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang  who are in turn after tom  
theres also a special twinkle in his eyes  as if hes gently mocking his own toughguy posturing  
i woke up early the day i died  unfortunatly  is so bad that its really bad  
 sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove  
the setup is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior  
this ones not anticlimactic  i knew it was gonna suck  
as i recall   wisdom  was a decent film  
whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming  yo  i gotta have sex tonight    
his tormented psyche creates a ghostlike image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation  
this has nothing to do with the story  
ofallon is someone whom im betting has seen reservoir dogs and the usual suspects too many times  for not only does his story veer off on bizarre tangents from whence they never return  do we really need the scene where dennis leary beats up an abusive father with a toaster  which is entirely unrelated to both the story and learys character  or the numerous anecdotal sequences    but the central plot itself is a serpentine mess  filled with crosses and double crosses and triple crosses    
this is a teen movie  all right  except the main characters arent teens  
thats really about all that can be said about the  plot  because nothing much happens  except that the main character  wisecracking jerry  andrew ross   has the hots for a cute blonde  kerry brennan   and there is a big contest in the climax  
if the relic is truly  the next evolution in terror  as the poster states  then the horror filmand humanityis in even worse shape than we thought  
in simple  the scene is earth  hundreds of years from now  
spielbergs greatest strength as a director is the polished  formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story

like the snake in  anaconda   the thirtyfoot monster crocodile doesnt seem real  it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural  
the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travoltas labor of love is a piece of scifi drivel  
the facepainting thats occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind  
does it work  
critique  a complete and utter mess  
although hard rain never really works from the start  i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen  
it is rated r for explicit sex  pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age  
the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d  tre  romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn  
the movie proves that you really cant go home again  or at least lynch cant  
the movie treats death as a joke  
unfortunate  since much of the dialog is terrible  
you continue to await some momentum in the story  something that could possibly revive the slow pace  
some of the things the characters do in this movie is beyond the bounds of idiocy  
the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil  who looks a lot like larry  
i mean  i was on caffeine when watching it  but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting  
most of the film is dumb  and most of the dialogue is inane  
funny  
the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie  the hot  young cast and the old standby  sex  
james mason  perry king  and susan george were wellknown and respected actors  mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt   and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career  
an elderly  fortunetelling witch arrives  
long time wrestling lovers  david and scott  dream of making it to the wcw  and watching jimmy king wrestle  
although the story could have been dynamite  it moves at a deadeningly slow rate  and i found my mind wandering every once in a while  
performances  however  were either wooden or  for the most part  unforgivingly campy  
yes  he is also built like a tank in this film too  
who the hell is loren dean  the dude who plays mumford in this film  
when the films success called for sequels  the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added wellintentioned  though not very subtle  political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s  
well  yes and no  
take  for example  a transportation system which utilizes the  inner winds   generated by earths magma flows  
the aristocratic woman  silvie laguna  who tries numerous times to commit suicide but is too inept to do it right  
his first two films were classic films  the second one being one of the greatest films of all time  
the movies main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys  the outsider who befriends new student josie  
although he is topbilled  here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum  who plays ricky hayman  the programming director at a home shopping network  
wyatt earp details thirtyfive years in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900

no idea  
in fact  things seems to have moved backwards  with people riding horses  shooting oldstyle guns  and living in large victorian mansions  
jay and silent bob strike back is a dumb movie disguised in a smarmy interior  
the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed  sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development  amanda suddenly becoming a great chef  her falling in love with tom  etc    sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good  
every time chase and quaid were involved in a gag  it just made it more and more apparent that they should have stopped this series after the third film  
she is pretty  but bland  and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person  
luckily for the vikings  however  their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film  
who needs the rules  
not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense  
such is the case with this movies miniplots  
based on a teen book of the same name and  disappointingly  adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson  i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top  
firstly  there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film  nor is there anything outstandingly good about it   but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid  
choir boy    
if you ever have to be chased by monsters  pray that you get the monkey warriors  
  much like this review you are saying  
the production values are high  as one expects from a big budget hollywood film  
too many of the wouldbe shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues  and the films chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that scream tried to subvert  like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they shouldand couldrun out the front door  
  gordon first discovers rita in a cage  waiting to be rescued   
we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure  before straight faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship  
seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue  heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones  which well always hear when seagal does his limbtwisting thing   rarely a female colead in sight  unless its a reallife modelwife who hasnt worked since weird science  and  usually the worst possible titles you can imagine  
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film  it is even worse  
then again  what can you expect from a director known solely as  mcg   
arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his sons affection is to get him a turboman doll  which his wife  rita wilson  who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this  told him to get weeks ago  
in the last analysis  since  8mm  falls short of its pretensions and its promise  its just another private eye story in the raymond chandlerross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege  
in an action movie like this  valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something  
six years later  karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight  
  americas sweethearts  has an intriguing premise and a great cast  but it isnt nearly as edgy or funny as it should be  
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell  
the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor  
we dont get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers  
the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shavedheaded character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen  
the films dialog not only isnt funny  its trite  
the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans  andy  tom everett scott   brad  vince vieluf   and chris  phil buckman   sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping  
however  the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences  
reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage  feature story coming soon   
he has all the money  all the sex  all at his fingertips  
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle  the first gun fight in the film   which really should be unheard of in a john woo film  but alas this particular battle couldve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi  of course excepting the  symbolic  pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture   
i think theyd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple 70  000  
the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out  analyzed  and discarded before it happens  
its okay  of course  because we all think he got what he deserved  
its no big surprise terl loses to the humans  hes an idiot  
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesnt focus on his own problems  
welcome to your ohso typical sequel  
im currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters

in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics  theres finnegan  treat williams   the boats pilot  whos supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff  joey  kevin j  oconnor   the inept sidekick whos supposed to be lovable and funny  but is really just irritating   and hanover  wes studi   the  mastermind   and i use that term lightly  of the operation  
the story in this new one is a mindless mess    the

theres no doubt that 95 of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern  guy sees girl  guy wants girl  guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl  guy gets girl

some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame  original characters onedimensional  and many elements of the story  like embezzlement and interoffice politics  totally incomprehensible for the little children  the main targeted audience of this film  
    without a believable performance between them  all we can do is sit back and watch the atmosphere  which is pretty good in places

one stormy night  the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder  
wait  maybe the only big laughs    
here  everything has been cheapened  
what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping  bad acting  and gruesomely gory  bloody scenes  
this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces  a fivehundredpound fat mans butt crack  and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old  
theres the occasional good one liner  but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour  
     amazing  potent stuff  
for the rest of us  the movie is immediately tiresome  
strictly speaking   tarzan and the lost city  isnt even bad enough to have camp quality  although casper van diens laughably stiff performance comes real close  
a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler  played with dramatic flair by barry pepper  ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the demons   
but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience  
instead  the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariahs most dramatic scenes  
for all its faults  the film actually starts relatively well  once you pass the painfully familiar teaser   
there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure  but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing  
despite this  which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun  though im certainly no expert   however  arnold  whose own heart is targeted a number of times   never  goes flying 10 feet backwards with a twofoot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun

praise for the film  in ready to rumble  i have discovered something even more annoying than arquettes att television commercials  
even earthshattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience  
in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two  yet ripley is now not completely human  possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being  
there are several times where hes in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself  the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill  
perhaps  if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or  perhaps  even three  there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development  or quality acting  or even a decent plot payoff at the end  
the movie doesnt make a lick of sense  though  either as an epic or as your basic boofest  
nobody dresses as bad as she does  
matthew lillard  featured prominently in said sequence  is cast as prinzes hotshot partner  and though the two are fine young actors  recently paired in the hit  shes all that   theyre fighting more than otherworldly evil here

theres an audience guaranteed for a film like this  although bad reviews and poor wordofmouth will likely ensure that it wont be much of a success

as the worlds leading expert on radiated earthworms  and wouldnt you love to have that printed on your business card

theres plenty more to tear apart in this film  
however  certain rules should apply to film  and one of those is consistency of character  
but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm  
bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy  but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic  rockystyle film  which it probably should have been  
overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists superiors  it sounds far better than it plays  and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant postproduction tinkering  its clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds

i will say this  you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope  
the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness  so they added romantic interest for their hero  public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kerseys crusade

when home alone was released in 1990  it was a breath of fresh air  and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinelyfunny family film  
although the acting is fantastic  even stallone isnt bad  the directing and story is dull and long winded

most of our planet is devastated  with humans living in a few protected cities  
for those people  it may be worth it  for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting  but when the story does intrude upon the festivities  the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes  musicians turned stiff actors  and the pointless 10year old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing  
lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being  pigeonholed   and  since her mother has money  we can only assume that thats how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses

these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous  
i dont blame this entirely on foley  because hes obviously a good director  
and yet in other scenes  the handdrawn material seems of the saturdaymorning tv crowd  which leads me to wonder    
and as a revenge movie  it is a crushing bore  
i love original plots  
this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness  
especially when their supporting players in clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief  lauren bacall as a former first lady  and john heard as the dan quayleish vice president

this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie  
its just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress  
i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard  
not for seagal  the snappy oneliners of arnold and stallone  nor the attempts to show that he can act  much less think  
unfortunately hes in the film for only about two minutes  
the alien is laughable  
  my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn  which was fairly well made on a small budget   
while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood  this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense

marg heldenberger  the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful  
cliff  her wouldbe boyfriend  acts creepy and sides with the network bigshots  even though he loved everything she did  
have a much better time  
what isnt forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface  
the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact its presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire  and is so pathetic its laughable  
certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as in your face  kick you in the teeth  take no prisoners   actionverb blah blah blah    
the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated  beautiful  mysterious  magical and spooky

then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy  
unfortunately  his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for  
how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story  
they arent  either  
deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that were expected to have a ridiculous good time  not hide our eyes

warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog  making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head  
the transfer is pretty clean  and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent  and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1  85  1  
everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b  
regardless of the role hes playing  he comes off as a weirdo  
instead  the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story  expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses  
last summer  a featurelength version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning

rob schneider stars as the title character  a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a  manwhore  to raise enough money to replace a wealthy clients custom made fish tank  which deuce destroyed while staying in his home  
the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible  
here  he is more of a wannabe serious actor  an impostor  
this quality  while fine for a 22minute television program  quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a featurelength movie  
i know its hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor  but i still think its a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise

the three leads all have welldeserved academy awards and turn in accomplished  if not extraordinary jobs  
while this film is continuously compared to the beatles a hard days night  i think that is an unjust comparison  
being the only notable member of the cast  the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity  making her characters catch line   dont call me babe   sound very ironic indeed  
theyre two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people  so clearly they belong together  even if paul is a loser  
i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted  
i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan  
if looks were enough to fully convey a character  she would have been brilliant  
they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage  
if you have a choice  pick this movie over the haunting  its the better of two evils  you could say  
the year is barely a week old  and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997the relic  a wouldbe chiller thats more successful at making the audience laugh than scream  
perhaps what  the 13th warrior  needs more than anything else is a villain  
even when we push them to the background  however we resolve these questions influences everything we do  
not one single scene in universal soldier  the return has any originality to it  
from that point  i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end  
i dont appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting  when in fact its ludicrous  
few years in the future  early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia  
there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague  
kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully  
judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional  annoying character  as she overacts every line she has  
what an awful note to end on  knowing there could be more of this in a year or two

eh he he he  the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg  
the film is outright stupid  but some of the elements are subtly horrifying

lets get this one over with as quickly as possible  
  get carter  is a gloomy looking  unimaginative film that offers no joy  
that is especially the case with jeff fahey  whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison

she plays claire cooper  a massachusetts childrens book illustrator whos plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children  
with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis lush cinematography  the film is at least a feast for the senses  
their achievement save this film from being completely braindead  but they are not actors  and therefore can not act  
  in addition  the film takes a bite into racerelated issues  and never develops them at all   
however  the main problem with the film is that it never answers the most poignant question brought up  where is the heart  
thumbs up to fichtner then  and thumbs downway  way  downto everyone else involved in this sorry mess  a movie so dull and pedestrian and nonsensical it doesnt even warrant discussion

movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so  and not one of them has ever been a hit  
still  at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer  
thinking about it  this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black  
as for washingtons performance in the title role  i figured id have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention its received  he is top notch  though still boring  
    pretty good  bring a friend  
it reaches an unacceptable level of badness  its so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was  
big deal  what do you expect from a gangsterflick

 chuck dowling  the jacksonville film journal 
now it just needs to work as a film  
a timeless epic it is not  
theres a full hour of charactersetups  none of which is interesting  then about 10 minutes of shaking  crumbling  and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold  narrowly missing   
fine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus  
  
seen this stuff before  
weve seen it before in passenger 57  executive decision  and countless other flicks that are good in there own way  
it relies on an audiences perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as nonhuman  faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration  
alas  the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle  
godzilla isnt completely without merit  although it is close  
not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonnys incompetent supervision  and this leads to a custody battle  
of course  ive never really cared for princes  or tafkap if you like  music  
remarkably devoid of any energy  especially for a horror flick  the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theaters armrest  
they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work  
they even throw in the middle aged wifes fantasies about a male counterpart at the party  
  in my films   writes director paul verhoeven  basic instinct  total recall    i hold the mirror up to life   
he  especially  looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be  
the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lotbored with life  not much ambition  promiscuous  profane  
in existenz  the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of overindulgence than anything else  
as i had mentioned  the acting is bad  
the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun  
a shame

fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson  
youre being hunted by a dragon  
to put it simply  the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation

terrorists can grab the headlines  but the tobacco companies have the real position of power  
but forget all that  it goes without saying that mad slasher films  or any other exploitation offshoot  will be made without an ounce of craft  especially considering the sheer volume that are produced   
but at almost twoandahalf hours  i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story  
somewhere  saving silverman  was meant to be a good movie  and it could have been  but alas in the end it wasnt  
and diane keaton mustve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one  cause her acting was amateurish at best  
new producer kate newell  kelly preston  is supposed to whip things into shape  
often i get to the middle of a story and say  ok  it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject  
there isnt a real person to be found anywhere in the professional  which isnt always a problem in an action thriller  except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more  
stupid or what  
the story of the studio is tragedy in itself  lets look at how it all affected the people  
people who read many of his books  however  often complain of repetitive plot devices  
the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake  a sign of a true  bmovie   
no one ever seems to find it in this piece of junk  
well  hes pretty much rodman  
he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher  in batman forever  but  here  left to his own devices  carrey quickly wears out his welcome  
see it if you like dumb thrillers  
skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards  
as unoriginal as the premise is  i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out  
as if afraid to let the viewer find their own  perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear  emotional foothold in the material  spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had  the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary  reminscent of the closing scene from schindlers list   the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close  every bit as bad as schindlers monologue about how his car  tiepin or ring could have saved another jew   quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson  captain millers last words to private ryan  and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain  
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director

we follow the wrong character  and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on  and way before rick can find it out  
the good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the lackluster story that follows  
one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has  kasdan  written on it  
it seems thats all there is in this movie  
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes

now despite all this negativity  and im not alone here    supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles   leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested  but excited about its release on dvd

the camera work is terribleoccasionally the camera lingers on  say  a closed door while the characters talk offscreen  or inexplicably zooms in on someones ear or nose  
this kind of humor can only go so far  but certainly cant go the distance in a fulllength feature

an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone  to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect

its not erotic  because it lacks sensuality  
the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity  as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be highquality stuff

as a film  the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale  a 100 minute long  just say no  public service announcement  but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie  
what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects  
the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster  however  
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story  but its as dull as could be  
there is virtually no fun in this film at all

other than the abovementioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have  
read a book  
it is a sad end to flanders career  getting caught up in a truly annoying overuse of mcdonalds as a location  a plot device and  apparently  a major advertiser  
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks  
this is a lousy  incoherent mess  
not them  because each of them would likely give you a different answer  
to be honest  i would be fairly hardpressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked  
in addition  the space is way too small for him  after all  he is a really big gorilla   
returning headlines michael madsen  who reprises tough guy press lennox  and ms  helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay  but theres realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis  
this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in  sub par  
though theyre not overtly transvestites  heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy  how very cruising of her  
the film then moves into a faster pace  that again slows towards the end  as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark  
the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space  which feature almost all of the movies top content  this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated  
it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth  looking wistful as ever  as a guy named    
but no  save lindo and aaliyah  who werent too shabby  i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly  
despite a healthy dose of humor and some surprising sincerity  the crow is still just a couple notches above its straighttovideo brethren

this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup  and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film  
you wont either

van damme doesnt land his first kick until after thirtytoo late for most action fansand by the time the hour mark has rolled around  your jaw will be on your cup holder and youll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess

while hanging out at a bar  he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth  
i find it quite entertaining  despite its complete lack of redeeming value  
benicio del torro is always welcome  though here he plays it fairly straight  rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage   adopting a brad pittesque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering  
the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr  pepper  with a 20 foot tall logo  saves the day  
this time around  the man with no name is played by bruce willis  a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico  
why didnt cross just look out his exec window  and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him  
though the film is distinctive  its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes  and as it progressed  watching became a chore

director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film  cronos   
to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap  
heres the kicker  though  i suggest that you do so  
but the main problem i found with  spawn   as with most films that wind up on my  worst of  lists  is that it was just plain boring  
as said before  young children may like it  but even they deserve better than this  
his performance is  almost  laughable  but there just isnt enough there to be funny  
if  analyze this  had been funny  the pacing and bad acting wouldnt have bothered me  
ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different  
all these people acted their parts admirably  as for the part that sharon stone played  she played it well but the part was not utilized enough  
appearing in d  c  cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else  especially irene  im gonna live forever  cara  
just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat  
sadly  hes barely in the movie  and rocks really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time  
this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently  and if memory serves me i cant think of one film that has done so  and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80s next to wall street  
he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simons house  where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide  
that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along  but this is not it

and why does he manage to take over ehdan anyway  
they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film  
hunter s  thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas  written in 1971  is already an american classic  not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the postpsychedelia of the 1960s  but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as  gonzo   
in the end  however  the new  psycho  is a noble attempt  but  alas  a dismal failure  
as a series   mr  bean  only ran for about 13 episodes or so  
death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend  living in the urban wasteland of east new york  populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out  
after many of the jokes  the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze  
the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be  todd fails to show physical superiority against caine  in fact  not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie  but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry  
but 1995 just wasnt that good of a year for him  
even the so called action scenes are extremely lame  and falls before it even gets a chance to go  
its definately not a koontz book if there isnt  1  a psychic   2  a superintelligent dog  or  3  a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peoples eyeballs  
however  if youre just in the mood for some good action  youd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work  such as supercop  
he has a few lines that are surprisingly thoughtprovoking  
even in china people seem to have problems relating to in laws  
and then theres the free clinic issue  which i find shockingly  frighteningly idealistic  
he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera  including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth   2001    whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in  zardoz  besides the inadvertent humor

some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others  almost as gifted  have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable  
the audience finds some humor in his foolishness  
it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene  mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise  
critique  this movie just didnt scare me one bit  
his placing of the characters  and the assination of the chinese ambassador  and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable  that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie  
but you have to wonder if the writing isnt even worse  
action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90 comedy  and even the action sequences are skittery  rushed and poorly edited  
he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate  that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself  
the film  supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business  is wafer thin  
the premise of   the butcher boy   is one that could have very well been turned into a thoughtprovoking  disturbing motion picture  but somehow nothing works  
it simultaneously exposed the 60s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die  
at this point  the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character  and couldnt care less about the two characters  
in fact  had it not been for fitchners sudden and bizarre appearance  and his jarring screen presence thereafter  i would have walked out  for  whats the worst that could happen   
i remember a film called  white mans burden  which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with its potentially brilliant premise  
in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor  
its not the most auspicious start to 1998  but it could have been worse  just think back to 1996s debut  biodome   
teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood  
dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable  and because of its masterful acting  
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season  that batterycharging  at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o shit that moseys into multiplexes  time of year when all those oscar contenders  read   quality  films  compete for audiences  
and if it does  how is he supposed to feel about it all  
but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write  most of you will see this film anyway  even if the tagline would say   some films are just born stupid   
wincott makes his villain  korda  as mean as could be  the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks  like richard widmark in  kiss of death   
everyone must know by now about the softcore acts of copulation  especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool  
my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin  who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen  
not that she is a wonder  but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent  
its amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens  
in the xfiles we get a fairly complete history of  the black ooze   what it is and what it wants  nbsp

steed  nowralph fiennes  and peel  nowuma thurman  are battling evil genius sir august de wynter  sean connery  who is screwing with englands weather  
meet the deedles  however  is painfully bad rather than laughably bad  
combining all that with a threetime oscarwinning director  robert benton of  kramer vs  
watching  flubber  really clinched this idea for me  because its just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy  
the jokes that are uttered are pathetic  and theres an hilarious running gag about siskel and ebert

the actors were superb  but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles

mind you  though  i mean this in the worst possible way  
he describes his torture by the demons fondly  as the  ultimate pleasure and pain  since at that level there is no difference between the two

among the parties interviewed are the films producer james edmunds  ryan oneal  and studio boss jerry glover  richard jeni   who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them  
not the whole story but no big context clues  
nobody in this film actually puts much effort  including madsen or lynch  and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke  
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly  which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut  
janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot  dealing with kevin

one problem though about the fight scenes  
for a while  sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the manmeetsalien situation  
his accent is so heavy  you cant understand what he says  and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act  and they know it  but they figure that if they flex their muscles  say a limited amount of stuff  and kill a bunch of guys  then they figure nobodyll notice  
i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released  but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature  like lightning you cant see it coming until it hits you

scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat  because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable  
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point  involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called  appropriately   whitey    but the script doesnt go anywhere with it  instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax  
kissing a fool  on the other hand  has nothing to recommend it  
in  returns   it was a good makeout scene with selena

unfortunately  this film isnt comedy and any laugh is unintentional  
its an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rockem  sockem profession of pro football

while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies  aki ross  voiced by mingna  and her mentor  dr  sid  donald sutherland   believe in a more organic approach

while this is going on  the thug  the father  the boyfriend  and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter

this is what passes for humor in the film  
only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances  the writing and visual style  but the storyline and the finished product dont work as well

the film would have been better off by sticking with the  rebel  tone it so eagerly tries to claim  
another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted setpieces  like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar  but there are none to speak of in this sequel  although they do come close at one moment with brandy

perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history

theres a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility  
apparantly money talks  
i almost dont even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from subpar to horrific  the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is  and she is  just not really here  and the latter being  and it pains me to say this as hes a particular favorite of mine  donald sutherland  who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performanceofwhichheshouldbeashamed

my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor  
when youre supposed to be asking   whats going to happen next    
wading through this gooey  detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic  
it basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain  and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings  
the title character of his pet project is a vicious  uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously overthetop by british actress helen mirren

the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse  
they are also mercenaries that have toughlooking haircuts  talk with accents  and try to show how macho they are  
and  boy  does he find out  
the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie  mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to

the tortuous paths of these various characters  and others named cookie  coco and cowboy  intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because  midway through the story  lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality  leaving a huge wad of cash  a blue metallic key  a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered

pierre boulle  author of the bridge on the river kwai  wrote planet of the apes  a  k  a  monkey planet   the novel  as a social satire  
its certainly not the cast  which includes enough hot  young talent for several movies  
maybe the novel was a stinker to start with  but whatever the case  its the writing thats clearly at fault here  
it is not good cinema  not good storytelling  and not even stupid fun  its so cynically  calculatedly boneheaded that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed  
the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldnt matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines  
donnie brascos take on american values  for instance  is feeble and obvious  
the  plot

woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground  as it is used so often in this film by both sides  so much so  that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain  
for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo  the killer  hard boiled  face off  appears to have made an exciting  elegant  charming spy thriller  kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american  read  unsophisticated  hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them  
in particular  one character  a chainweedsmoking guy  is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesnt die soon enough  
she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown  but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff  
the major problem with eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward  always unsure of its ultimate destination  
i give it a d  
after thousands of headless productions  this theme has become one big clich   
ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul  and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career  
  me  myself  irene   by contrast  seems to have been made by folks who looked at  mary  and saw only the surface grossness  missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  
  
after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i cant stand getting slaughtered  which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i cant stand not getting slaughtered  
granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you  
in fact  this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness  
unfortunately  the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds  
everything is just too clean  
the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all  
it stars sean connery  who can still carry an action film despite his age  catherine zetajones  a likeable enough film presence  and ving rhames  ultracool star of pulp fiction and mission  impossible  
it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more  
for two hours

most of the humor in the film had come from klines insistence that he was straight  while at the same time  loving poetry and being a senstivie guy  dressing well  and occaisionally acting prissy  
my recommendation  if you go see it  bring a watch  
ever since that film  the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy

soon the army  advised by dr allison reed  moore   moves in and forces kane and block out  
the cast tries hard  especially hank azaria  whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume  but the script is just too lame to run  
but no number of redlit  rainsoaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman  
as you should know  this summer has been less than memorable  
you would think that this films dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and  americanizing  it

consequently  while his career highlights include jaws  close encounters of the third kind  stakeout  and tin men  his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador  let it ride  and now krippendorfs tribe

  is a best trailer category at the oscars that farfetched  after all   
  party camp   is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies ive seen in awhile  
this one starts it off horribly with no plot  no intrigue  and crap dialogue  
i got news for you  eric  nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that  this is 2000  you know  not 1985  
wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer  
supposedly were to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan  but the script never sets that up  so the scene is merely silly  
cant beat that   
living in a world of heroin induced highs  they float along until they fall in love with each other  
from the start the film is unclear of where its going  not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table  constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality  and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film  
li is as spectacular as ever here  and i dont think anyone would ever dare call his martialartsstar skills into question  
they give real cops bad names  
    unless youre a huge fan of the games andor the first movie  
this section of the film  involving all manner of derringdo involving a speeding bus  is perhaps its most effective  but it also points up how all the other storylines  the publisher  the documentary crew  lack a satisfactory payoff  
as i mentioned earlier  nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film  
the scenery is boring  
at best  it is a 1940sstyle b movie  
the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious  but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions  
it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall  for crying out loud  
also  the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry  
some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie  others are simply good ideas that are badly executed  
now i have to admit  its a lot cheaper to pay 5 than 200 plus to see the play  but thats what did me in  
nor human nature  nor anything else  for that matter  
this picture was so bad  it inspired the description for my 110 rating  see ratings chart below

you dont have to be carl jung to understand that dream  
bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence  
how julia roberts is used solely as a  puppy dog  character  puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zetajones character  who is not one bit funny or romantic  two ideal ingredients in a  romantic comedy    is also beyond me  
but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergioleone style mythic posturing  
it sure doesnt seem like it  
but  as i said  it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder  
every now and then  the filmmakers get it right   clear and present danger   which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way   but  the jackal  is an example of when they go completely wrong  
i somehow doubt it  the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isnt attempting to be the utter farce which it is  
screenplay by robert j  avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots  scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch   
   you dawnt own mah life   
harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesnt drink  
but in my audience  there were no females present to make googoo eyes at prinze or lillard  and many a member exited after the muchballyhooed sneak peek  
the latter is really too bad  
you see  to put it mildly  zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets  
most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid  jerky way that its impossible to comprehend whats going on  
its nothing more than a special effectsextravaganza  visually impressive  but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesnt engage  
     amazing  potent stuff  
in protecting lee  arnold is framed by the mentorturnedevil robert deguerin  nicely played by james caan  and ends up having to prove that he isnt the one killing the programmes witnesses in addition to making sure lee isnt accidentally torpedoed to death by the new  green guns his enemies all have

jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes  penis jokes  flatulence jokes  film pastiches  and injokes  
or is it a combination of both  
there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization  and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches ive ever seen  
now that the real indians are perennial contenders  they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks  
do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can  
kevin pollack plays jerichos security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides  but like most bad action movie sidekicks  he disappears after about an hour  
because of this  i will try to vary word descriptions of  sex   meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms  and  or your name is jerry falwell  you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen   so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend  fret not  its most likely just another way of referring to  sex

i counted at least half a dozen times that bluescreening was painfully obvious  
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher  who  s previous two films  se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation  
the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending  which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of  sneaking up  on a mans house  who they know to be guilty of a crime  
the plot is fine better than the movie deserves  
if it was a challenge  i wasnt up for it

he was alone in a world where he didnt know who to trust and it came across real well  
he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis  
veteran readers know that  as a rule  i dont encourage people to patronize lousy films  
but here  characters farting  belching and almost getting crapped on  literally  is not amusing   
and it should have been  
throughout the whole film  he looks angry  or just pissed off   
those times  hes not bad  
i asked  
newman  sarandon  
its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated  yet trys a bit too hard  
there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though  like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space

eraser  back in 1996  was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense  
but director joel schumacher  the completely wrong guy for the job  puts style over content  and while the direction and look are good  its just not very disturbing  
i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of  sleepy hollow   
nothing much special

i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart  but dont want to bore you too badly  
the basic idea of the film is solid  
in past horror films  the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims  
now with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy  they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree  that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow  
your shirt  man   
scriptures do speak of revelation  
oliver platt  famke janssen  and even sean bean are decent actors  but the stuff they are given here  such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch  is insulting and demeaning  
the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic twohour commercial to watch it  
that is  until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him  wear  his spoon   you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass   
like dark city  mimic is a definite case of style of content  
that term may be too harsh  but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is mission to mars  my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient  
she was underused  considering she is such a wonderful actress  
therefore we the audience get loving closeups of the most unrealistic  rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film  
he proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt  on himself and the queen   and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion  
i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies  
capsule  godawful  comedy  thats amazingly shabby and cutrate  and rather bereft of laughs  
there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is  the characters are not  prioritized  so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important  before they know it  he or she or it perishes     rather 
and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is

beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop  
let me be the first to say  ready to rumble  is a huge disappointment  
the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does  
its not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly  and i mean constantly    but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged  
except this time  at the end of the millenium  the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be  
could have lived with it  
a real dud  
they grunt and groan and babble about monsters  
billy zane is wooden as the hero  
he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes  
  con air  buddy  fathers day  romy and michelles high school reunion  murder at 1600  8 heads in a duffle bag  anaconda  vegas vacation  meet wally sparks  metro  bevery hills ninja  the relic  all is forgiven   
i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a maxsized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons  
no attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors eyes  a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work  
they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness  but they give you nothing to be really sad about  
henstridge  just like every other actor in the film  delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey  
so  why dont you conjure up positive thoughts of annie  and let that run wild  
at ten times that height  godzilla would be more likely to knock it over  
you see  that person then has their legs swinging in the other persons face as they drive and that distracts the driver  see  and well  thats kinda funny  no  
so special effects or not  if the story isnt the least bit scary  you arent going to end up with a very frightening movie  
its certain that  like the murder weapon described in the films title  jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience  
but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs  hogget swinging from walltowall of a ballroom in elastic overalls  
unfortunately  eye of the storm  which was supposed to be intense psychological drama  deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale  
i think at the twenty minute mark  there was still a spark of hope in my heart  
to tell the truth  i enjoyed portions of this movie  but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called  2001   
seduced  harry agrees to participate in a moneymaking scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette  chloe sevigny   the teenage daughter of a rich man  
unfortunately  this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre

phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character  while christina applegate  who plays melvins fianc  e  is convincingly airheaded  
i feel like i should have had a grand time with  detroit rock city   
the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism  it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted  much of the earths surface would still be above water  and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown  
crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tvs  star trek  the next generation   
with bad excuses for acting  a horrible screenplay and straightout bad direction the bachelor is a terribly unfunny movie that doesnt work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance

poor kyle  a meek looking jon favreau     he is about to marry his radiant fiancee  laura  cameron diaz

dudes    you 
but as things stand now  there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last years film has led everyone down this path  so screw them for not trying as hard  critically speaking  of course   
its here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place  over whether or not patch can become a real doctor

lucy alexis liu  of t  v  s  ally mcbeal    who plays a spicy sm dominatrix  brightens up every scene she is in  and has a definite flair for comedy  something i would have liked to have seen more of  since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat  
oh  the writing  
when she delves into marthas dark side  predictable cliches  chainsmoking  staring in mirrors  praying in a confessional to a priest who isnt there  poking a hole in helens diaphragm so shell become pregnant  and she does   abound  but its moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch  
okay  first of all  the story is just plain boring  
  no fun whatsoever  
the film is watchable just for the antics of the jeff goldblum comic performance  
neve campbell and starship troopers denise richards getting it on  
in a sense  thats half of the basic problem with  switchback   
these are the first words that came to mind after it was over  
that this bigbudget remake wont rise above its roots is fairly obvious  
comments  so  what do an exgangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop  a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem  and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common  
keep cool  a chinese film directed by semiaccomplished filmmaker yimou zhang  was one of the kickoff films for this years hawaii international film festival

by turning against the queen  dutch defies his partner  the infamous lucky luciano  andy garcia   who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace  
i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success  40 million domestic box office gross  more frightening than anything in it  
this doesnt really happen  nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on  so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it  
louise fletcher is alright for what its worth  but she could have done a lot better than this  
the film will work just as well as a silent movie  
a bleak indie film about a stolen identity  
the professional is all over the map  and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant  
this plot is very flimsy  and doesnt give a whole lot to work with at all  
in 1995  an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus  thus wiping out practically the worlds population in a mere month  
the  eaters of the dead  are a faceless mob in blackface  
its hard to make a good actionadventure movie that doesnt simply recycle its predecessors  and ive seen movies that even at least did the recycling gracefully  
probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing  allens elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character  
basically  this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it  
the heroine is an attractive  carefree  nonreligious 20yearold  chaja  fraser   who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations  screwing a student rebel leader  and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother  s  gebrecht  and her selfabsorbed  eccentric father  schell   
the satire is missing here

best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks

watch out for those bad bluescreens  
those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the films two stars  jake gyllenhall as the immunodeficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his overprotective  hyper religious  reaganloving mother  
cross  william lee scott  scott caan  and james duval   
this is home alone all over again  and ten times worse  
his latest picture is therefore visually impressive  but intellectually hollow  
im not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick  because im not sure just what the hell  pardon the expression  was going on in it

director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis foamingmouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration  
at any rate  i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous  but shes a walking dressup toy  
my suggestion  steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead  if you can find it   
and that is schwartzeneggers strength  muscles and no emotions  
thats a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie  which seems to go on forever  
so far  so mediocre

wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret  so its quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen  
of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell  
one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access  
a chase scene in san francisco  
the supporting players are given very little to do  
i can picture it now  
after all its not a coincidence that you cant pronounce her characters name without  appeal   
while they are still impressive today  they arent impressive enough  or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film  
we never really get that impression in the movie  there is no firstperson voiceover narration and some scenes dont have hammer in them at all  
by this time  though  most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep  
the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys  
the biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film  kay chandler  kristin scott thomas  and dutch van den broeck  harrison ford  are the only two major characters alive  resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious twohoursandthensome production  
the end result is rather forgettable effort  which convinced me not to watch movie again

for one  george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do  
and during each of these scenes  i was sidetracked by my earlier question  
but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make  
governor ratcliffe  for instance  is a snobbish  singleminded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses

when grandpa dies  taking his department store down with him   social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder  first and middle names  
but the fun doesnt end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne

  its not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death  but it makes a certain kind of sense   
  analyze this  has a few laughs sprinkled throughout  mostly in the first half   but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan  ramis  and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke  robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles  while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal  and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106minute running time  
tommy lee jones is as fine as ever  although his role is hardly a challenge

  caligula  allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name  a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing    or

the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile  the charmless rooms and corridors of a postindustrial apartment complex  photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible  
in a perfect world  i would be in charge of all the movie studios  
it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences  which frankly  get quite boring after a while  
im not even sure i can call whats here  performances   though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger  
but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work  especially in the case of kurtz  who very bluntly shows the dark  hypocritical side of the religious right  and a wacky sendup of a cult called  bright n shiny   led by the inimitable fabio  
denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation  where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone  
i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the 4 to 4 scale  
although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success  their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate  twoman vaudevillian act  
however  its horrible schlock  straight out of hollywoods vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies

while total was written well  starship is purely pathetic  
its a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high schools resident jock stud dane  ethan erickson  to demonstrate  using a popsicle  exactly what he would like for her to do to him  
karl  on the other hand  has grown up to become kim  a drabby  insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company

it doesnt matter that he has witnessed all of her murders  
i felt like the director wasnt very interested in the proceedings himself  almost like he made this film for a paycheck  
it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town  such as tolerant vicars and policemen  plenty of eccentrics  and of locals who stick together through thick and thin  
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book  burtons new version is even less faithful  
or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woos hong kong films combined  
and so they glide from one clich  to the next for 108 minutes  
he also produced this mess  which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards  
and the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moores breasts in  striptease   
 please catch deep impact before it finishes its run  it may be the only  meteor worth watching in longlong time  
having been produced by the same guys who made  mary    irene  seems like an even bigger disappointment  
nothing else  
not bad  but wouldnt the police  or maybe batman   
much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense  and there are such gaping plot holes that its terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief  
its a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film

at the very least  i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me  
i guess the filmmakers knew theyd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didnt even bother to kiss ass

but not scary  
ill pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101  this is a nono  dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass  speaking variations on  it wont hurt

bilko is played with finesse and fullforce by the renowned comedian  
there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology  so why mix the two together  
woo finally broke through and made  faceoff   but it still isnt up to par with his earlier films  
if a film like  psycho  does not frighten  then whats the point  
the writing doesnt help much  either  
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way  shape or form  
i guess someone put a spell on this movie  
the only saving grace was the requisite titshot courtesy of jill whitlow  
having said that  the show itself is outrageous  funny  and always filled with goofy surprises  as opposed to this film which features no laughs  is this a comedy or a drama    uninteresting and completely unbelievable onedimensional stereotypes  and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way  
although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie  his man here is really rather amusing  when the script gives him a chance  
huh  
 in large part a satire of life in newfoundland taking licks at things like the poor produce  
obviously  the producers thought they could remake  the deep end of the ocean   throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama  
delicatessen could have some appeal to the cult film crowd who like their meat sliced thin  monty python fans  and those who liked terry gilliams brazil  a film similar in spirit  
why shouldnt i have know what i was getting myself into  
see  
soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it  
its the last thirty minutes of the movie  then  that wrecks the film  
after a great opening  in which an american spaceship  plus the city of new york  are completely destroyed by a comet shower  nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy  
it had absolutely nothing to do with the story  but i liked it  
the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes  
add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history  literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect   and acting roughly the caliber of a b  b  gun  and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer  definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year  
sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians  
when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david  for example  diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states  im so sorry  your lease is terminated   
he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost  
i cant even call this film predictable  since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this  
we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down  
they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well  
in this category  for example  you have ace ventura  private eye on the mild side  and airplane  
as ive given to the financiers of james bond movies  its time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director

hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one  
thinking rudy is nick  he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino  which nick use to work at as a security guard  
but the film talks down to the viewer

he also pays a visit to old flame dr  ellie sattler  laura dern   jurassic park    now married to another with a young son who calls grant the dinosaur man apparently for the sole purpose of dredging her up again for the films poorly imagined finale  
the film is bleak and ugly looking

tim robbins just keeps piling on political views  and characters  that we just give up on the film  or in some cases walk out  
in the first few scenes  reeves anchors the film  but then slowly drifts into the background  
while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures  take  for example  the schlocky mountain highs of last springs  anaconda    deep rising  has no tongue to put in its cheek
