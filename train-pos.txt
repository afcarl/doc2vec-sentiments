  the bridge on the river kwai  shows the  madness  of war and what it can produce in peoples minds  
or at least the mayor of dantes peak  linda hamilton

it is not fun to watch  see something else if you get upset by realistic  sadistic violence  
mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty  the parttime gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together  
while the full monty is a great lighthearted comedy  it doesnt carry the social impact of the brilliant trainspotting  
it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda  
and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time  a final battle is inevitable  
the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though  and eventually begin to take on a life of their own  beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after   
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1  85  1  enhanced for 16x9 televisions   
the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its r rating  
like  stand by me   this is a mostly characterdriven film  and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting  
what im saying is the first half was extremely slow  
i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12  2001

armageddon actually has characters you can care about  
  gods and monsters  is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture  impressively directed by bill condon  who  i sense  relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone  
never for once  was it trying to be manipulative at all  the full monty was true to itself all the way  
he also earns his name as the movies narrator  spouting memorable lines like  the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didnt exist   although  obviously  he does exist  what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996   while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri  any actor with multiple zs in their name is okay in my book

a very good cast  which also includes bill paxton and william hope  highlights this action film  making it stand out from others  
little known in the us to date  his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver  
we hear how they went to the same town  and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times  
he creates fascinating  complex characters  especially dr  fuentes and domingo

  failsafe   usa  1964  drama  111 minutes 
there is even a sweet but significant irony in the films unspoken take on race relations  something an american audience at least would do well to observe  
i still think that  the bridge on the river kwai  doesnt deserve being the number 13 in the american film institutes list of the 100 greatest american movies  
so many things in the film weve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited  
it probably wont beat titanics box office record  
getting it right is the simple story of gavins awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right  that is  to find the right woman to fulfill his life  
harold pinter is amusing as harrys uncle benny  who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways  
still  this movie is one that will please many viewers  
whats the greater good here  
some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc17  mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women  and initial reports said the film was unwatchable  
while it does remind one of danny boyles shallow grave without the abundance of black humour  it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality  or the lack thereof  found in a film with this subject matter  
now he cant satisfy her need for physical love  he try to persuade her into finding a lover  with the ulterior motive to make her describe these affairs to him in every detail  
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown  
the visual is not very important

a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas  texas  
when he finally got out of prison for good  carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer  seemingly having his career on track  until the police framed him for multiple homicide  
the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering  though  but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience  that shouldnt be too surprising  
heavy spoiler    
the film is two and a half hours long  and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action  
not sure what to do with it immeadiately  he decides to throw a giant reunion party  inviting back all his old chums  
we then see a dream of roses  in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson

  magnolia  uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters  
is the small farmer about to become extinct  
they are boarding the titanic  which is sailing to america  and this is where she is to marry cal  
the final scene  involving mortizen and everyone else  is utterly devastating  thanks to him and thomsen  whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex  
another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard  denzel washington   the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities  
then on the flip side of the coin is the tired  contrived character of harry stamper  bruce willis  who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i cant quite place   the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie  
like thunder from a quite sky  his mother dies  giving birth to his youngest brother  
it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand  and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho  
and jar jar binks  a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character  is intended as comic relief  but what he really becomes is annoying  and fast  
if youre a fan of contemporary  edgy music  it is an even bigger draw  
her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald  who hasnt made a worthwhile film since 1986  
its a good movie  and tells its story well  but august tends to handfeed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle  
bruce willis portrays his character perfectly  balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully  
slim  played by portly sammo hung  better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies  is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york  
in fact  its actually good  
tarantinos talky style manages to hold your attention heavily  but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline  
even if  gattaca  were dramatically empty  it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials  the films look is dazzling without ever being flashy  
but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go  
this flick is scary  not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes  
like leiters character  wai lin would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later bond movie  
the starstudded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin  jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while  
the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time  
this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick  and after the movies genuine dramatic setup  it is dessert  
as such  i respect the way the film looks  
pleasantville could have done that too  if it wasnt for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films  
its tense  exciting and fascinating  
movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency

the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam  and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line  
dr  forrester is convinced that one too many b movies is all it will take to ruin a man  but with a couple of wisecracking puppet buddies  tom servo  voiced by kevin murphy  and crow t  robot  voiced by beaulieu   the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema  
  when youre the middle child in a family of five million     he comments about his neglected childhood  
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video  
i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role  but instead of being likeable  she comes across as rather robotic  and as such its hard to see why cusacks character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful  intelligent writer  natasha gregson wagner  potentially waiting in the wings  
many thought the final chase scene went on for too long  and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action  
freedom has many faces and  brokedown palace  explores many of them  
and while this uproariously funny  grossout summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste  it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end  
a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting  an intelligent script  and masterful directing  together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days  genuine motivation in a story that rings true  
this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination  but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the  fun  game of football  or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and fortyfive minutes in the movie theatre  or in the comfort of their own home  depending on where you watch this stuff   
i dont know how he does that   and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely  
one night he runs into a prostitute  a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue  how far she has come since  adventures in babysitting   named sera  
on the road  he witnesses a racerelated mugging that turns into murder and  frightened for his own safety  runs away without telling the police  
in many way they are also more realistic  they were personally staged by lee himself   demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent  
the animation is rich and colorful  with lots of wonderful details  the  cinematography  is also extremely improved since toy story  there are a lot of complicated swings  turns and closeups that really make an impression  
and ruthless people  
is it the acting  
brandy in particular was impressive  considering this is her first feature film  
as a business proposition  it seems hard to see how it can ever break even  but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful  
give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements  
at least it does until he forgets what he was going to say and gives up  
the guy has grown up  
and because  above everything  it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew  
hints are dropped from various times of the night kimbles wife  helen  sela ward  was murdered  
still  the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable  
alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters  
it suffers a falloff once giles reaches new york  and the ending  with its nonetoosubtle homosexual overtones  is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it  
the slavery issue is easy pickins for spielberg  
hes a serious gangster unaware that he is a comic gold mine  
that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey  who has achieved legitimacy at last  
but i bet you will not leave the movie  for at least laughing one time or more  
but  unexpectedly  he gets anything but that  
pfeiffers performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong  as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion  you wonder how  how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism  
it won the 1977 best picture oscar  and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production  
marky mark  plays eddie adams  a seventeen year old with a certain gift in the midriff area  
still  constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative  
even the heavy  agent mansley  is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to  but out of his own fear and paranoia  
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty antihero skin as his career progresses  here he explores a new genre  the businessman as action hero  
gas stations are the same  
one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station  
but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the presidents ability to control them  
for  while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers  it also stretches our credulity too much  and raises more questions than it answers  
that was achieved rather well  with some interesting commentary and observations  
it is very ironic  when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story  howard hawks thing and byron haskins war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind  
in his absence  he has assigned buzz lightyear  tim allen   now comfortable in his role as a toy  to take charge  
they even get to meet the president  
and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear  will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa  
it is here  where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jeanbaptiste emmanuel zorg  gary oldman  murder in the first   
so overall  i loved the whole  feel  of the planet  the apes that ruled it  the manner in which they treated the humans  screamed  shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain  but didnt appreciate the films lack of human character development  why was kris kristofferson even in this movie   and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring  
what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that  and the ending is shocking as its a definite work of dystopian propaganda  but doesnt have the down ending of other works of this kind  
one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions  
through some interesting detective work  bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news  
opinion  director alex proyas  he also directed the crow  mentions this in the dark city press kit  in films  science fiction is always  used to have big spaceships blow up cities  
jonathan demmes direction is bizarre  in nature with the story  and he creates the right mood  making it a tough film to sit through  making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters  
   
some colonial masters were better than others   
structured somewhat like a  diner  a few years later   this feelgood story is a good time  but ends a little too nice  
at first this characters hyper energy is funny  but the act wears out its welcome very quickly  
when lee goes into a karaoke bar  the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan  john lone  and his hoods  carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff  
the acting is superb from everyone involved  
hes also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator  such as a twentypound block of cheese  
the new america  on the other hand  fares no better  ideals of the socalled  sexual revolution   same as all other  revolutions  of the swinging sixties  degraded into exploitation and depravity  
once there  this flaxenhaired fishoutofwater not only survives but tenaciously thrives  befriending a local manicurist  jennifer coolidge   dazzling a professor  victor garber  and rescuing a defendant  ali larter  in a celebrated boston murder trial  plus finding a more worthy beau  luke wilson   
the biopic pollock  actor ed harris directorial debut  reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollocks creations as part of the order of things  and should similarly disarm haters of fine art  
this time  ill just say that i went to mcdonalds yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry  and tarzan was on the cup  
the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt  emotive performance as the niceguy husband  who is as authoritive and likeable as tom  
bobby is buttondowned  tightlywound  always waiting for the next shoe courtesy of ricky  to drop  
another nice touch is the music  
when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them  okay  well  they didnt really  fax  them     
stone  of course  is useless  making a pretty poor wife  and a pretty poor action hero  
but even the tiniest details reveal quality  
this time  its an extended sequence that finds an africanamerican couple  jada pinkett and omar epps  attending a sneak preview of  stab   making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat nonroles of blacks in slasher cinema  
the film is set in burma in 1943  
but he comes back  only to storm out again  disgusted with whales  locker room talk   
we basically watch as our three leads watch  only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary  
perhaps the only thing i didnt like about  frequency  is the overly sentimental coda  during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard  
almost every cent thats invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts  and as chan does his own stunts  the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills  
and what a ride it is  
the reason  toy story 2  works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the originals success by redoing the same story and using the same characters  
it seems like a warped idea  but it is andrews idea and he did wonders with it  
barry sonnenfeld  who also did the addams family films  directs this nicely  
and finally  the phantom menace works because  as in all his films  there is no shortage of speed and action  
jay is a motor mouth who hasnt met a subject that he couldnt vulgarize  
actually  its not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each ones own romantic tension  
special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable  
thats predictable  
im more impressed by it now than i was while watching it  and to me  thats a good sign  
even though the backstory is unusually strong  mitchell never forgets that the production is first and foremost a rock musical  
however  the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this  producing one the most nail biting  or in my case  straw of my drink biting   
what would be the  final act   
this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept  the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way  
the story of  babe  pig in the city  is an enchanting yarn  but one that doesnt achieve the emotional or character depth of the original  
that is a story familiar to millions  but herzog has elevated stokers tale into the realm of  and i use this term a tad reluctantly  cinematic art  
the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scenestealing acting  
restraint was shown where necessary  letting the more critical effects look more impressive  
the church  calvinistic  is so strict that the church bells has been removed from the clocktower  they are considered being too unrestrained  
ever mindful of each others positions  anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs  conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying  if not achingly bittersweet  
positions are scarce and when he does finally find one  he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking  
when greg first meets his fianc  es father  jack byrnes  the grimacing robert deniro   greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive  
things begin to change around him  blinking red lights let off a strange hum  for example   and he fights to stay in control of his own senses  
mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games  
by this time  rameses is now pharaoh  and the two brothers  now on opposite sides of the line  face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention  
and  a breakthrough   
the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in  
herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights  sounds  and affectations of the 1980s  
the sixth sense  atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer  tak fujimoto  is actually a dramaits spooky  effective ad campaign is misleading  
thats why i just cant believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime  
but in the hands of park and his team  the stories felt fresh and inspired  and not the least bit contrived  
for example  several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later  there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick  but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion  
throughout  we get to meet the parents of the dead  broken souls who follow stephens like  the pied piper   passages of which are read during the film   
also  the ending  while having you fooled for a moment  is rather contrived  and somewhat dissapointing  
however  fate has a cruel trick for phil  and he starts reliving groundhog day over  and over  and over  until he gradually likes it  and rita falls in love with him  
while in  out doesnt carry enough to give it four stars  it remains one of the best done films of the year  allaround

fletcherchannel 8s illnatured  hardnosed ownerveteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy  he really hams it up with his snorts  grimaces  and scowls  
directed and written by james cameron  t2  judgement day  the abyss  true lies   the authority on action films  it was a masterful encore to his scifi thriller the terminator  1984   
pinkett yells at the screen   
roger murtaugh  danny glover   
  paulie the talking parrot   the voice of jay mohr  soon regales misha with his life story  
tarantino keeps things moving along nicely  with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction  but  on the whole  this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself  
cities fall  
done in film noir style as a murder mystery  this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels  
there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery  but at the centre there is frustration and futility  and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people  until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity  
saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time  
oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer

 visit  charlie dont surf   
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles  from the subtle to the ridiculous  and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some  seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers last two films  they almost all work  
shaw delivers the story in one long take  and it is the best acting in the film  
penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesnt do anything new with the role  and eventually she becomes just a distraction  never integrated fully enough into the story  
weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence  
you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies worth of stories into two hours time and didnt fall apart  although many other critics might beg to differ   
hes also half of the glue behind the years best example of pure entertainment  
mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for  
the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions  the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes  
yes  the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent  
titus isnt a complete success  but it is never less than fascinating  and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice  
there is only one  fleeting scene that suggests this relationship  but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film  
i must say i was not disappointed at all  and the film is the best of 2001 so far  and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year  
searching for a way to get information on the government  osnard sets his sights on harry pendel  geoffrey rush   an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite  
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  
fellini couldnt produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie  
the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love  
from the giant mansion used in the films centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harfords apartment  this film is always a pleasure to look at  
however  while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u  s  for ordell  jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus  michael bowen  and atf agent ray nicolet  michael keaton   who catch her not only with the money  but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs  
george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting  as his overthetop impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting  
not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town  but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place  
unfortunately  the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor  
after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies  its downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty  
and the film doesnt consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in  paths of glory   
while i didnt really have much of a problem with goldmans screenplay  i do need to point out at least one inconsistency  
he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club  and decides to manage it full time  
its very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic  vivid sense of reality and life  
i did and man to me its the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film  
there was also an instance  towards the end of the film  in which one of motsss forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away  
mostly dead silent  some quips are made  almost as if to lighten the mood  
the phrase especially goes for oscar novak  an architect who is the main focus of three to tango  a delightful  funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself  
hanks has his decent guy routine down pat  yet each time he does it  it seems effortless  spontaneous and fresh  
the film is like a twohour episode  except that there are a lot more special effects  the plot is thicker  and the resolution is more satisfying  
if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens  despite the droll performances  the laconic humour  thats because kaurism  ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered  
my favorite line of the film comes from charles   most people die in the wilderness because they didnt do the one thing that could save their life    
i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise  so instead i will avoid it entirely  
this time  williams is after matron  jacques  when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr  goode  
it made sure that we didnt just care for one of them  
based on the life story of david helfgott  this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a childgenius  compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father  
well  what does all this have to do with natural born killers  
unlike chewbacca and c3po  who got their humanity  if youll pardon the expression  from their interactions with the human characters  jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind  at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive  teenage mutant ninja turtles   
jackie brown stars pam grier  the  blaxploitation  heroine from the 1970s  who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character  
in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabos sunshine  a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes  hungarian aristocrats  nazis  and communists  
it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor  exciting in its adventurous exploits  funny with its dry wit and cute voices  and breathtaking in its presentation  
for unbreakable  shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which  in many ways  blows away the film that had come before  
in story one  helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james  john hannah  on the train  
that is no easy task  
i bet the film takes castros power for granted  and that this or any other movie  produced under cubas state control  cannot question his right to run cubas political show  ongoing now for more than 36 years   
the script does not have a lot of oneliners in it  and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams  but overall the story is exciting and interesting  
in an advanced state of putrefaction   she laughs when handed a bagged watch  insisting that this is not her husband

fortunately  barrys replacement  thomas newman  contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate  human conditionssonorous  stringladen passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic  introspective movements ripe with nuance  
indeed  he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart   you dont get reformed  you just run out of wind   
except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city  the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table  
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain  
a certain number of people will be lost by this  but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times  
the film is set in toronto  and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence  
as far as the subtitles go  i have to say that theyre among the most easilyreadable subtitles ive ever seen for anything

this is  in fact  a steve zallian film  not just the work of a hack  and zallian is the director of the muchadmired  search for bobby fischer   didnt see it  and writer of none other than  schindlers list   
whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams  is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable

for the first time since the beginning of 1999  there comes a film which doesnt rely on popular formula stuff  such as bigbudget special effects  commercial rock soundtracks  or any of that stuff  
while the eschewing of  ferocious pairing  is a favored topic of conversation in the film  the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love  lust  and trouble with each other in an emotional merrygoround that cleverly develops its characters through the  preferred  dynamics of social group interaction  
come to think of it  perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films    its 
however  i cant honestly say how it could have been done differently  and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film  and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery  
when he goes to the church where they met  he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife

allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill  
many things are explained throughout this film  both to the characters and to the audience  
director verhoeven is the main star of the film  
did wind up being the first person i suspected  but believe me  i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie  
in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler  
the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy  and im thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format  
the primary reason i enjoyed this film was  that while being a comedy  the film also had an intelligent story to tell  
the next morning  he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck    not 
director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle  
is it the script or the movie as a whole  
the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired  
the supporting cast are fine  and not even the comedy sidekick  this time in the form of a taxi driver  is annoying  
  
ordinarily  that alone would be enough to sink a movie  but in the case of  fallen angels   this is not so  
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jeanluc picard and delivers a moral speech  picards trademark  with his usual aplomb  
when oddsandends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco  she notes resignedly   its all the same  
as the plot unfolds  magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are  
jane campion  too  has a topflight cast working for her in  portrait of a lady   too  but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted  virtually lifeless mess  albeit a visually interesting one  
before long  he is forced to spy on his loving wife  louisa  jamie lee curtis   an aide to the canal director  
however  to his credit  he does manage a terrific first half  
while a long  or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob  panning from the mobs belly distorts the audiences spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene  we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large  
the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time  yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end  
which is not to say that secrets  lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master  
no disrespect intended  but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same  
luckily  the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages  yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie  
there are none of the standard  hokey angel references used in recent films like  angels in the outfield   1994  or  michael   1996   
after all  old ned wont miss it  
which means the plot isnt quite as crowded  
as the droopyeyed  drugaddled steve rubell  myers is worth the price of admission alone

they even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades  the chicken vs  egg dilemma  
they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company  the eccentric jerome facher  played by robert duvall  more on him later on   
he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable  
the film circles around this  then spins off into nonlinear flashbacks  all done in black and white  
will smith and tommy lee jones both do great jobs and both are a blast to watch

the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this godlike kurtz  but the scenes fall way short of expectations

some amazing animation is present here  and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone  although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film

blade  played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers  and wild  played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor  are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop  respectively  complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been onetime partners in music  but also partners in bed  
the word spreads instantly through town  
the performances could have used some fine tuning  in particular  theres an annoying  overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely   and the movie doesnt always overcome the limitations of its genre

thematically in cinema  love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters  it is rare  however  for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benignis neoclassic drama  life is beautiful  
firstly  the running time is a bit too short  
be forewarned  
shauny sexton  an erotic dancer and pinup model  makes an impressive screen debut  
the acting is good all around  with standout performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner  and leland orser  the poor bastad in  se7en  who performed the  lust  sin  as an anxietyridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him  
the plot in brief

the digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here  unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original

spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects  
patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i  the king longshank  
beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the innercity lingo and working that into his speeches  instead of trying to sound like l  l  cool j

however  he runs up against one man who doesnt believe in reform  
the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail  and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic

or can karen straighten out jack before he goes too far in pursuit of just one last crime

donofrio as whitney  who plays a pivotal role in support  also turns in a good performance  
his emotional intensity is brilliant  
he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do

his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle  as disturbing as it is hilarious  
the sex in the film is rather unneeded  but compared to ozons criminal lovers  its the disney channel

but one day  the two children are killed in a car crash  and it almost destroys annie

his name is derek vinyard  and hes played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks hes almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as  say  malcom x  when we first see him  hes clean shaven  with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast  a devlish goatee  and hes attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets  at least when he doesnt need them  
pressure is mounting at the wrong time  
the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images  but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance  magnified by ten  thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed

then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation  underneath the title credits  thats far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts  probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life  something were not used to seeing on screen

al pacinos slade was a largerthanlife individual  robin williams sean mcguire is much more subtle  
but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film  he transcends the poor actingmusiceffects and conveys a sense of the fantastic  of otherness  
although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours  the climax comes fortyfive minutes before the end of the movie  it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end

the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing  
the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened  yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant  static and cold  mediocre performances by hurt and connelly dont help either

of course  nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads  and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists  backstabbing  and deceptions deliciously unfold  the strength of jackie brown is the quiet  understated relationship developed between jackie and max  when they kiss  its perhaps the most tender scene of the year

only paul d is suspicious of the stranger  
a recurring series of flashbacks makes the film seem more complex than it actually is

but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that  
hang on for the whiteknuckle thrill ride of the summer  
the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie  
matinee is not like that  
along those same lines  its almost unfitting to compare the two  johnson uses tension  humor  atmosphere  and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions  
also noteworthy is the score for the film  done in a marvelously lush orchestral style  not representative of most hong kong fare  
as odd as it sounds  its true  
eventually these people are found out  and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully  until in the end they all have a showdown  
brosnan  all around good guy  will  of course  save the day

of course  its no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind  
by including the vignettes  itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film  but surprisingly  they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline  
comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres  so take my recommendation as you will  for me  the big lebowski is very funny  
wahlberg plays davidson not as some gungho hero  but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home  
his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly wont hurt  
roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as hes supposed to be  
also disappointing is natascha mcelhones character sylvia  
  so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walkon  
an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron  and only hen wen has the power to show its location  
the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing  any more than that would be a spoiler  
beavis  butthead  yes  those are their real names   are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones  
larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme  with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech  
this is a thinking mans slasher flick  
if it wasnt for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote  which are rugged and certainly flawed  the story of us would have been this years best picture  
the contrast is amazing  showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing  
but  always  sonnys past is lurking a step behind him  waiting to swallow his progress  
liam neeson stars as jean valjean  
youd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines  
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 2 on the 4 to 4 scale  
what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber  
the soldiers dont mind killing other soldiers in blind battle  but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go  they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses  
capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50s to make the movie remarkably enjoyable  
their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant  
as compelling as the narrative is  viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu  
its a lot of fun  and it doesnt overwhelm the rest of the movie  
they just work together  and its nice to see  
somehow joe escapes  but his dog rainbow dies  
altmans cinematographer  changwei gu  gives the film a dark  soaked look  
he does so  and finds out that he can do anything  be anything he wants to be  
the conclusion  while funny  is also surprisingly weak  and certainly not strong enough  
so  he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers  sort of a texmex version of the punisher  if you will  
both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other  seeking comfort with the other person  but while pat starts to form a deep love for her  judith only wants to remain friends  
he is the best action director out there  topping renny harlin  who directed cliffhanger   and only he could create something as terrifying as this film  
together  the two actresses work extremely well  though  and both have to go through deep emotional hell  the likes of which havent been seen this year  
if you like something so much  why even question it  
mcgregor is wellcast as obiwan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility  
the one scene in the movie that  could  have been a good sex scene  berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool  is not exciting  because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator  
barry pepper  adam goldberg  vin diesel  giovanni ribisi  davies  and burns are the team sent to find one man  and bring him home  
the constantly moving camera doesnt really allow for the audience to associate with any one character  
this is most likely due to anthony hopkins  who once again displays his superb acting skills  
playing the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos  sancho and angela molinano lookalikes spring to mind  but they round out the excellent cast  
but arthur is determined to keep his familys word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that  
onebyone the people start to disappear  
while this may give the two leads more screentime  many of the small characters are onedimensional  and the killer  when revealed  is extremely implausible  
some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking  
its nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films weve been getting throughout the year  
but there are true moments of riveting suspense  and great performances by branagh  davidzt and downey jr  more than enough to see you through  
it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary  
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do  
branaghs forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical  but at least hes very good with making a less ambiguous film like this  
jake kasdan  son of one of the best screenwriters around  breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hardtocategorize detective story  part mystery  part comedy  part character study and part romance  
and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that  the director  who builds the film up wonderfully  with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script  and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades  
after the feature  which runs about 63 minutes  is included a new music video from type o negative  the blackandwhite fangfest  black no  1   
simply putit bleeds creativity  taking the look of the original film to a whole new level  
its my christmas present  
watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question  
the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence  
in disneys mulan  when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army  
one problem that scream didnt have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer  
there isnt much of an emotional core to desperado  
she is the most interesting character on the screen  who is forced into a world where she is not wanted  
but which is more important  
its among hundreds and thousands good films released every year  not better or worse than the average american film  
like the children it portrays  the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a showstopping performance at the legendary concert hall  
there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship  ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire  their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love  
when done properly  not only are they actually exciting  but they foreshadow things to come  
the film even makes fun of itself in a line  something along the lines of   its funny how england and southern california look nothing alike   
schrader uses modernday new york english to tell the story  along  with new york words  new york mannerisms  and new york slang speech  
the first one  myself included  liked movies that featured spectacular car chases  lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions  
like the other musical released in 96  woody allens  everyone says i love you    its a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead  but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance  
  kundun    presence   a name the monks call the young dalai lama  opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader  
for example  robbie tells his exfianc  to  get out of my van halen tshirt before you jinx the band and they break up   
i know he wont be nominated  but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february  
from the very beginning  when we see an interactive internetlike promotional video for the armed forces of the future  it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly  
instead  reese travels out to their lake tahoe home and lures beau out to the boat house where beau learns that his mother was right about reese  
of course  the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic  
there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake  but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel  surprise  surprise for a sequel  right    
in fiction  one invents purposeful  clearcut good guys and bad guys  puts the fictional characters in conflict  and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion  
mickey during his marriage to mallory   as creator of my universe  i pronounce us man and wife   
on the downside   toy story 2  follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale  and some sections tend to drag  
synopsis  great expectations  1998  is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel  
im not the war movie genre biggest fan  but i found this film to be gripping  and very scary  thanks to the excellent cast  direction and terrifying battle scenes  
the regiments greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle  thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner  
the script is also to be commended for its wellpolished dual nature

the jawas  or small creatures who sell droids  pick r2d2 and c3p0 up to sell  
many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal  canada  joblos haven of restfulness   
a little unrealistic  but who ever said a kids movie had to have the slightest hint of realism  
instead jones plays him as a sharp  committed man whos just doing his job  so that when he responds to kimbles comment   i didnt kill my wife   with a matteroffact   i dont care   we know exactly what he means  
it makes your blood boil  
i dunno who thought of casting him  but if theyre reading this  news flash  eric roberts is  not  a star  
there are moments of brilliance  but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene  
the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting  
finally  theres mckellars friend  played by callum keith rennie  a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of  
lien keeps crawling into hais bed at night  causing him to fall out of it  
there are no dramatic sex scenes  but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slowdancing  always moving ever closer together  that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together  
riccis character is funny and different  
the second act is as immersive  brilliant  and haunting as any film that i have ever seen  
one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman  dylan mcdermott   a rich  wellknown businessman  
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions  
the opening sequence is one of the most rockin scenes to open any action movie  and the subsequent extraterrestrial  transformation  is another eyecatcher  
and hes fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities  so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections  
with his lightning quick reflexes  immense strength  and impenetrable armor  s  c  i  
beavis even tries to use the remote  though there is no television there

im not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life  but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution  of australia  and certainly sounds impressive at any rate  
best known of them is david patrick kelly  whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains  
this isnt a kids movie  
the puppeteering is phenomenalobserve the scenes in which jen plays his flute  or the landwalker chasebut i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture  a delicatelynarrated  by john baddeley   absorbing prologue

after watching the film  the first thing that came to my mind was   ive got to do a remake of this film
